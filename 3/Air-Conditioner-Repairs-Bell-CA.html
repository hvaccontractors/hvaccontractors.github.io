<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
