<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
