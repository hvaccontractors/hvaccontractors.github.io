<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Burlington IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was unbelievable, useful and valuable - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were polite and conscientious. The work website was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
