<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
