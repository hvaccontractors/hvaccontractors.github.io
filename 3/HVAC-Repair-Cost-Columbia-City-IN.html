<h3>Electric Furnace in Columbia City IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and shorten its life. Too small and your ac system will not have the ability to cool the house effectively. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into consideration when purchasing a new AC system. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
