<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move warmth.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
