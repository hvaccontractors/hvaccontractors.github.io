<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Basics Handbook includes heating and cooling calculations. The design professional needs to seek advice from ASHRAE data for the requirements of design and care as the typical building regulations supply little to no info on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however.
