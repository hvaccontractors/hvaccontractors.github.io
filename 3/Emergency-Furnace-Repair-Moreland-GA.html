<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common structure materials utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Since the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
