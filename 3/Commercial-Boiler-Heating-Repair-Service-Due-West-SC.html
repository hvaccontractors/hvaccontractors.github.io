This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
