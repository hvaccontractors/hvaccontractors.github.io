<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
