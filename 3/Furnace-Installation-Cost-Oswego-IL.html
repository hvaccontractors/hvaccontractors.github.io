<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
