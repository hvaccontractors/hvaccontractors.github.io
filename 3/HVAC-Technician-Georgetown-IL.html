<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space. The bigger the area, the more effective the home heating unit needs to be.

<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system too soon, before the mortar has actually cured, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the guarantee of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run before the compound had cured. And mortar producers might refuse service warranty coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
