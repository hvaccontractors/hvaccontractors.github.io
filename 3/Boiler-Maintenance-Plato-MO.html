<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>

<p>The reality is, air contamination in your home can be simply as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors.

Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the options for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
