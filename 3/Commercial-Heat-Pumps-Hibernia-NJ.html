<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system.
