<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Systems in Paris AR</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on price. It's hard to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
