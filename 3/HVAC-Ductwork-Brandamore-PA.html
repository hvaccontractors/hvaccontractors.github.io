<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
