CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
