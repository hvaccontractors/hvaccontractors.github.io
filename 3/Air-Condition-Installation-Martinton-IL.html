<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same.
