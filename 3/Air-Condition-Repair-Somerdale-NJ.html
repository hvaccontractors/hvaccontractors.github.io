<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
