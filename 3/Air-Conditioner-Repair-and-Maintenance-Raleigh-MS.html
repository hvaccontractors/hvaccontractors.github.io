<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered fantastic customer service at the end of the visit by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we may want to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>

In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan.
