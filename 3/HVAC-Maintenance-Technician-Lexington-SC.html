Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
