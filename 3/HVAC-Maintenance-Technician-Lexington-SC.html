<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
