<p>There are 2 primary types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we advise using our insulation boards. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a terrible, cruel summertime.<p>
