<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
