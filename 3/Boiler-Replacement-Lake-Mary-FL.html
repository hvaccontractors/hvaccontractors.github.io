Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
