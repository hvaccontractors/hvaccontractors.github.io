<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not toxic, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria might also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
