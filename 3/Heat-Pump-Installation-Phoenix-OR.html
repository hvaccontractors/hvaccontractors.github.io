<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
