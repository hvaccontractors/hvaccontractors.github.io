<h3>Residential HVAC in Hamel MN</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There are some more severe dangers for HVAC workers that could be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be dangerous. As HVAC service technicians regularly come into contact with circuitry, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of burns and abrasions to the skin. Although there are risks associated with the job, it is generally performed securely as long as proper care is taken.<p>
<p>We have been exceptionally happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked effectively and is so efficient that it significantly reduced our utility expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they responded rapidly and fixed the problem.<p>
