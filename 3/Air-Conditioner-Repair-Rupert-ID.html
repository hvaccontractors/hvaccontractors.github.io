Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

Ventilation, a common approach of reducing exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will lower but not remove direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to considerably lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Subsequently, the most reliable method to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove cigarette smoking there.<p>
