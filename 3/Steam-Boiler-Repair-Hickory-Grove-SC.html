<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
