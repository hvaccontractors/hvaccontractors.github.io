<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
