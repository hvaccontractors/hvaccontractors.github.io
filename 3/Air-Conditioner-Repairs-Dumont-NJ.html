<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Dumont NJ Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
