<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
