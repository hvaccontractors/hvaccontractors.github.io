<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced reasonably, have handled the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is definitely the best I've had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been terrific.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
