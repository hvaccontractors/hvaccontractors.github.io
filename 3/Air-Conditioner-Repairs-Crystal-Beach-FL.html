<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
