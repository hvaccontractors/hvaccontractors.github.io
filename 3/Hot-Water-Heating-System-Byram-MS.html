<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heat pumps typically require excavation to install, which includes several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
