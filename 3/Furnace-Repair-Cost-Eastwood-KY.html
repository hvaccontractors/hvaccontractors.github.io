<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a number of unique advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

Transferring heat through strong items will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A house warmed by a radiant system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

Such information can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out.
