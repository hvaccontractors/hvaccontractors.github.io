<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>That stated, when you talk these factors over with Seattle HVAC professionals, different companies may often suggest different services.
