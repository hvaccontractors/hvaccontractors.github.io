<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
