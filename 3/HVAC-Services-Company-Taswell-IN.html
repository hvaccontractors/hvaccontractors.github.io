<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
