<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
