<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are seldom utilized due to long-lasting destructive issues.
