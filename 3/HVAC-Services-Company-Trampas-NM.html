<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
