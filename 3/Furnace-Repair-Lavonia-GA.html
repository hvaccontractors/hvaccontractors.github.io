<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got.

ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
