<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the home.

<p>For example, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a way that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outside air intake vents can also generate air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
