<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
