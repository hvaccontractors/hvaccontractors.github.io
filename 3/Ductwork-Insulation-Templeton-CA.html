<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
