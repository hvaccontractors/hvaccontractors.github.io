<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the ac system: Don't put it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
