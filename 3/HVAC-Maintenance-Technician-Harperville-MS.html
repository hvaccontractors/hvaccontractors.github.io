Especially if you require a brand-new unit or system, the best HVAC company will supply you options at different cost points.

That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
