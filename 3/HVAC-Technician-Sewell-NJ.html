Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path.

Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
