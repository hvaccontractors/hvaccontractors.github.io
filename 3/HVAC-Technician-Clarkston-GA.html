<h3>Residential HVAC in Clarkston GA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When the temperature levels keep climbing, geothermal air conditioning is a smart and cost-effective  way to cool down your house or place of organisation.

At Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we offer geothermal cooling repair services to commercial and residential clients alike.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
