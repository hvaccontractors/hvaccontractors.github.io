<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
