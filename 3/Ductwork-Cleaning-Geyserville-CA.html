<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and keep.<p>
