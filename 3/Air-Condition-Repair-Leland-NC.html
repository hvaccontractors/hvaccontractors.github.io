Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is associated with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air.

Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
