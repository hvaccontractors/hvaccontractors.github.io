Eye and respiratory tract inflammation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are amongst the instant symptoms that some individuals have experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics.

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a mild environment, where the temperature level does not get too low or too high. In other words, they are best for our Seattle environment! They are extremely efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating systems in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
