<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most budget-friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
