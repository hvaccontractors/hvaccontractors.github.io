<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide advice to change rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more efficient design can combat unstable energy costs, minimizing your heating expenses by up to 45%. Developments in heating technology have actually caused systems that contaminate less, increase comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty years of age furnace usually has an AFUE of about 65%.
