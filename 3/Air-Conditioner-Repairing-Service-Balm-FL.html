<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
