<p>We look at hints before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires managed by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
