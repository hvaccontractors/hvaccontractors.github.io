<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
