<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of a/c unit, numerous primary aspects need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the location of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system should likewise be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently discharged outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop sharply.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
