<h3>AC Replacement in Glendale AZ</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The repayment for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the lifetime of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a conventional system.
