<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the technicians believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
