<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets.
