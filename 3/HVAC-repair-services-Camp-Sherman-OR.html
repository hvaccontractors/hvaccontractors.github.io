<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
