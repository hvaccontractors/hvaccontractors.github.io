<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The primary danger of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic homes is the capability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing illness.<p>
<p>Some health results may show up quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and normally short-term. Often the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Right after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some illness such as asthma might appear, be intensified or intensified.<p>
