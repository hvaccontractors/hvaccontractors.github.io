<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a service. A skilled technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, however there are many other pollutants that can not only filthy up the air, however cause other health issues.

<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
