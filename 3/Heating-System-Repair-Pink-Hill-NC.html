<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a standard forced air heating system.

Required air heater likewise tend to generate hot and cold spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>
