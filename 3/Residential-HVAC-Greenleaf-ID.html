<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Greenleaf ID</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may activate attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and might cause cancer in people.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
