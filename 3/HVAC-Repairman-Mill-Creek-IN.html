<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
