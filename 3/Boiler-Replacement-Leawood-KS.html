<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on.
