Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Your house convenience is our top issue. Here at Scott's One Hour Air Conditioning & Heating, we go above and beyond to make certain that you're comfortable with every part of the service process. Our professionals go through a rigorous screening that works out beyond the market standard. Our owner, Scott Vigue, sticks to a 17-step interview process to make sure that every technician on the team is experienced, well-informed, credible, and meticulous.<p>
