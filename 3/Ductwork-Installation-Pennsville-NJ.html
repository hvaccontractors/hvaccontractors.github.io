Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
