Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the form of electricity. The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
