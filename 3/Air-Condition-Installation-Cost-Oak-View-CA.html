<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home.
