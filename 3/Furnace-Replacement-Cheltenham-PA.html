<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
