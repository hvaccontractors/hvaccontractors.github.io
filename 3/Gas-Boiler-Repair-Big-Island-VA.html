<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit. Due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
