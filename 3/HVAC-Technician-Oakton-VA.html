<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you're looking for an honest, hard-working, extremely trusted, & well-informed air conditioning & heating contractor - give Around the Clock a call! I was initially referred to Ilan & his group by several of my neighbors when I moved in 5+ years earlier. I have them carry out an annual tune-up & the a number of times I require a service call, Ilan was able always able to fit me in the exact same day. They're excellent with the interactions - phone, text, email! I position allot of value on a small company owner who resides in the community he services.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
