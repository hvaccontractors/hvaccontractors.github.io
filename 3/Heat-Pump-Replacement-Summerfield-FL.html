<p>In basic, ductless AC units are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than conventional Heating and coolings. This is due to the fact that you can shut off specific spaces when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and lower their temperature level quickly, conserving you energy and cash that regular HVAC compressors will lose by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
