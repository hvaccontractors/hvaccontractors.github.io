<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Playa Vista CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
