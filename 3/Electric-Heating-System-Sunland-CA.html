The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
