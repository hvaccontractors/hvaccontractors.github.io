<p>Both need to be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil.

<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
