<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists suggest following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
