<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
