Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
