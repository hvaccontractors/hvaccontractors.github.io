Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high bills. Heating systems often lose their effectiveness as they age, specifically if they have not been appropriately kept.
