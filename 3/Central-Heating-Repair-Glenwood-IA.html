<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
