<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves checking the recommended connections along with temperature and pressure assesses. Take time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion. Green projects represented 20 percent of all newly built homes in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
