<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
