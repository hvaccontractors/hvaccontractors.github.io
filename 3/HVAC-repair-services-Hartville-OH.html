<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
