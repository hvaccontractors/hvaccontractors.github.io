<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce floor heat.<p>
