<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling equipment. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
