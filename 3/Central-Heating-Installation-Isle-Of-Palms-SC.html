Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>To protect family members with asthma or to minimize the possibility that somebody in the home might establish asthma, the home should be checked for prospective indoor asthma triggers. Each space in the home has prospective asthma activates. Some problems can be fixed rapidly, but others might need more time and work to control or get rid of asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical smells and scents, contribute to indoor air contamination and have been known to asthma symptoms in delicate people. Other sources of indoor air pollution may be harder to reveal. For instance, using room deodorizers may mask the smell of mold. It will improve the indoor air quality if the source of musty smells can be found and eliminated.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
