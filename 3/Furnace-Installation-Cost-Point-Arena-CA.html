<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
