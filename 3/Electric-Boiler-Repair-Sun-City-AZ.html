<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Sun City AZ</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
