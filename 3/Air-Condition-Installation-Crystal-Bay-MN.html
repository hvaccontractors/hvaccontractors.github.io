<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
