For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
