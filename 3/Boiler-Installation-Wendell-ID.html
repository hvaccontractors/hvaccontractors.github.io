<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.
