<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
