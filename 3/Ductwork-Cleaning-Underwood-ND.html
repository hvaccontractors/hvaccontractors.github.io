<p>A matched system is the combination of products that make up your HVAC system. Depending on your area, a matched system can be made up of the following: an ac system and furnace, a heat pump and furnace, a heatpump and air handler, an a/c and air handler, or an all-in-one packaged" system. By integrating components that are made to work effortlessly together, you can produce a more efficient ideal system.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Prior to you begin installing the real duct work, it is very essential to plan out your duct setup in order to ensure that there is enough space in the floorings, walls, and ceilings to run your duct which there suffices space in each room of your house to link the heater. After you have actually drawn up the whole network of duct work, set up the ducts piece by piece, making sure that they reach every room where you want heat distributed.<p>
