<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
