<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Germantown TN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
