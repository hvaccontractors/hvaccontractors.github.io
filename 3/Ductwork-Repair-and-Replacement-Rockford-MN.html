<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
