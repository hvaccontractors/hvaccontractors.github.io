Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue.

If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
