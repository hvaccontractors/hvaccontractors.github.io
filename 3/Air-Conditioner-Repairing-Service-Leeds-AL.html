<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
