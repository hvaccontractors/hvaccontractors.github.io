<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
