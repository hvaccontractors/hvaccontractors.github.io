<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
