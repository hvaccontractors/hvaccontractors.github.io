<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if essential, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
