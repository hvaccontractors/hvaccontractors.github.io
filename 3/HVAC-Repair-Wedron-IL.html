<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
