When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
