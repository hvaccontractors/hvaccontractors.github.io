<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Bluffton IN?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
