<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.

This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
