<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
