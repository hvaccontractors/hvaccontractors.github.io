<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system.
