<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Ruth MS</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
