<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
