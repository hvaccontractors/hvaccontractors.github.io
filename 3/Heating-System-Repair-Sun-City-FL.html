<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
