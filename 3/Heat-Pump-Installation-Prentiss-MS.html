<h2>How To Hire HVAC Companies in Prentiss</h2>

<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally turns up. It is extremely essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do see your furnace acting oddly. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the issue worse, and typically more costly.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
