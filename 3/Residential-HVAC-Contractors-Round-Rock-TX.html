<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in little amounts is not harmful, but may end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Germs or micro-organisms might likewise exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread throughout the whole work environment or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
