<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally uncommon now.
