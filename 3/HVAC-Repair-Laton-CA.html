Load computing is described as the Manual J estimation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of an unit required based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out.
