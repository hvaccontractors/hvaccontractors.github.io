Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
