Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
