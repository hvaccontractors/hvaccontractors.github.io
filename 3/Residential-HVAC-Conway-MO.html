<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
