<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one.

Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
