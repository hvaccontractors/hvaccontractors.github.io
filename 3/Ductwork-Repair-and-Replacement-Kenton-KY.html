They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Kenton KY</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is usually utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
