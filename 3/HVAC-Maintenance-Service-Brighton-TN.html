<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
