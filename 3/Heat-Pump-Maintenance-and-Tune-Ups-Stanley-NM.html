<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Stanley NM</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
