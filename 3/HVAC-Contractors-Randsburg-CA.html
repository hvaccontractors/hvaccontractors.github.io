<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
