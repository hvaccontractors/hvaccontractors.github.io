<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in manufactured items. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can require to select products that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
