The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
