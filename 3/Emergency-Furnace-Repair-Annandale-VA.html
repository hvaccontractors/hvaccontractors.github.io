<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.
