<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
