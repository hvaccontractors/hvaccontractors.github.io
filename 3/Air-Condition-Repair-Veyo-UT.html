<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
