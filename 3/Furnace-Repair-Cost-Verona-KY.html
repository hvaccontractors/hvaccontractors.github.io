<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant results are typically short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
