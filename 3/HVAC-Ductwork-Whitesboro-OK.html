<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
