<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have learned how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
