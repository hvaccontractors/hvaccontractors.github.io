<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a method that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.

<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
