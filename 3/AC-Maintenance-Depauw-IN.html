<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
