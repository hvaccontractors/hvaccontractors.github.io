<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While many people assume pollution is just an outdoor issue, your home (and workplace) can likewise be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe sufficient about exposure to all the things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>

Natural ventilation plans can utilize really little energy, however care should be required to make sure comfort. In warm or humid climates, preserving thermal comfort exclusively via natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Mount Sherman KY</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
