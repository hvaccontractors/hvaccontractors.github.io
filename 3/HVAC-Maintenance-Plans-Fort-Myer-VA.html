After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency.

<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Fort Myer VA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
