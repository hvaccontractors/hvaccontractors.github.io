Location the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter.

<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
