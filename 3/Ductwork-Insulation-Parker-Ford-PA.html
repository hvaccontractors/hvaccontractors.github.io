<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
