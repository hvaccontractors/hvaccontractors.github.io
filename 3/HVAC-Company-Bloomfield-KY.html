<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have.

Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
