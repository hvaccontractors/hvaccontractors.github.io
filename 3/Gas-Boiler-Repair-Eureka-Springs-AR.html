<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been effectively dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
