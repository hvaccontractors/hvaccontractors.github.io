<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
