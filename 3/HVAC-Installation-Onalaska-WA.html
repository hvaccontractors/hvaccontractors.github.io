<h3>Air Condition System in Onalaska WA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might end up being extremely dirty. These elements of the equipment are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans up all parts, and checks connections to guarantee they are safe. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for correct function and general condition. This is an outstanding chance to identify parts that are worn or defective. Replacing them to fix the cooling might be a lot more economical when the problem is relatively small.<p>
