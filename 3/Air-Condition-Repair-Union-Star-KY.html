A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
