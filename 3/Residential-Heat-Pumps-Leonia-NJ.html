<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
