For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions widespread in the house.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and vehicle emissions in attached garages.
