<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat your home. Truthfully, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and keep.<p>
