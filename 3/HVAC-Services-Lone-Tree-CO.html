<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
