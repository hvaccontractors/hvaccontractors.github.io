<h3>HVAC Company Near Me in Hollis NH</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradesmen.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
