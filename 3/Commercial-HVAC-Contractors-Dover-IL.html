<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
