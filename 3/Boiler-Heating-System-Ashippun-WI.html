<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
