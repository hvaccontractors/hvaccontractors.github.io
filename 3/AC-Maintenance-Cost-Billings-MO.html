<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
