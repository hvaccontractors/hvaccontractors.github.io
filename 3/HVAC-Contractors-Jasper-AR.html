<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
