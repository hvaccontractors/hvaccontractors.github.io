<p>Sean was really handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
