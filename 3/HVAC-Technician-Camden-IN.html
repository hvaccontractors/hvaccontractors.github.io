<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>

Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.
