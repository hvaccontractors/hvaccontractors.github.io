<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Ductless AC System in Burlington ND</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents.
