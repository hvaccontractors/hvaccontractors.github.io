<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead.

<h3>Gas Heating in Littleton CO</h3>
<p>It's a truth that a brand-new furnace for your house is among the more considerable costs associated with own a home. But, it must likewise be seen as a long-term financial investment. All of the current furnaces are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years ago. So, while it may look like a short-term bigger expense, a new, more energy-efficient house heater will more than likely save you cash in the longer-term by lowering your annual energy costs.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the concern and repaired extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
