<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Gretna LA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
