<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects.

<p>Given that heating & cooling work might also need repairing or setting up pipes to supply oil or natural gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a different plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumbing professional on call.
