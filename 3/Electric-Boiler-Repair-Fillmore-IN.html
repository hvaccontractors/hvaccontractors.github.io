<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space.
