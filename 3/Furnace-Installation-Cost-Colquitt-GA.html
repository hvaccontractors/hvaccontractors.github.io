<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at Colquitt GA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
