<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time.

Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
