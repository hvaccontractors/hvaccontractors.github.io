<p>A split air conditioner consists of 2 main parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided air conditioning system rely on a set of pipelines to connect the outdoor to the inside air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split ac system installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>When central air service fails throughout a heat spell, you might need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll probably pay at least a number of hundred for the repair.
