<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
