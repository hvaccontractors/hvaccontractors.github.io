<h3>Heating Systems in Clarkridge AR</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on price. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
