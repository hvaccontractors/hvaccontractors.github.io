The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Space air conditioning system feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or act erratically if the sensing unit is knocked out of position. The sensor must be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
