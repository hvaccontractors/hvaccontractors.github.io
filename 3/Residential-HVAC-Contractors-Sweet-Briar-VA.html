<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
