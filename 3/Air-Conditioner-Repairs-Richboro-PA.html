<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
