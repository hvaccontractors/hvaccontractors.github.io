<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Plaza ND</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heating unit. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but result in greater energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, however save more over the long run. Prices for gas heaters vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and vary approximately $1,700 or more depending upon the brand name and furnace size.<p>
