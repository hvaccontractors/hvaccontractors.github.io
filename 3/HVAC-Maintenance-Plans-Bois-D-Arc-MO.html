<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
