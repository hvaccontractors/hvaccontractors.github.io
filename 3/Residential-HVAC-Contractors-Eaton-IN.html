The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public attractions.
