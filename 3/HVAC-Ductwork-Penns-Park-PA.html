<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Considering that 1985, the Department of Real Estate and Urban Advancement (HUD) has actually permitted only using plywood and particleboard that comply with defined formaldehyde emission limits in the building of upraised and mobile homes. In the past, a few of these houses had elevated levels of formaldehyde since of the large quantity of high-emitting pushed wood products utilized in their building and construction and since of their reasonably small interior space.<p>
