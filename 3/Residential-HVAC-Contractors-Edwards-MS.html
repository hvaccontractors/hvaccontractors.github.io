<p>Homeowners may also assume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts home worths.

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
