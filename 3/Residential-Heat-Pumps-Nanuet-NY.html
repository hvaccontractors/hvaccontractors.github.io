<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is generally used in a third-floor or second location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
