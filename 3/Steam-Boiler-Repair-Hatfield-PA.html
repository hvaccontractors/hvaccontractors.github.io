<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that disrupts the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a range of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, confusion, queasiness, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are in some cases confused with the influenza or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderly individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>
