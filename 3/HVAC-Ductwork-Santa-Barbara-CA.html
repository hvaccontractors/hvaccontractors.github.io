After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
