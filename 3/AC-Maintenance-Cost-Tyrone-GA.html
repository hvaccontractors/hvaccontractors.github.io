<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
