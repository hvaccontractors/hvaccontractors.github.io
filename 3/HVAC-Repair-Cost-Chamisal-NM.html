<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
