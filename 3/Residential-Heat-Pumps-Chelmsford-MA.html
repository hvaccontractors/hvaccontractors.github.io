<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to cracks and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
