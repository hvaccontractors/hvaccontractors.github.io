The outdoor system must also be located in an open area, otherwise the heat from your home will not be efficiently released outdoors and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is extremely suggested to set up the air conditioning unit systems in easily accessible locations, for additional maintenance throughout operation.<p>
