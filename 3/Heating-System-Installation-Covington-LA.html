<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
