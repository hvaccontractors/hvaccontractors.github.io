<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
