These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

As a result, there has actually been a boost in the occurrence of reported health issue.<p>
