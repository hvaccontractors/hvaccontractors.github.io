<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
