<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents.
