If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
