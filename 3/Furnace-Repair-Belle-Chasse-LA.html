<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Belle Chasse LA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the exact same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
