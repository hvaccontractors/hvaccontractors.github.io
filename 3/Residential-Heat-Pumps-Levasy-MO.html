<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>

Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
