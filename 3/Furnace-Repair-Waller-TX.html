If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
