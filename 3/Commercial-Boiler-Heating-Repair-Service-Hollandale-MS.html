<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The crucial portion of your air conditioning is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage during the winter season. Most of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is pretty basic to remove. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated moisture, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to ensure sufficient air flow around the system.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
