<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a service.
