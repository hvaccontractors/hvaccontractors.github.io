In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed results might happen.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the truth of a cruel, vicious summertime.<p>
