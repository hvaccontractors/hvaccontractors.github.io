<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
