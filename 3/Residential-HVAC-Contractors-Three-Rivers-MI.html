<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for instance), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread pollutants from one part of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these issues.<p>
