<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have been in presence since the mid-90s, and the idea established much earlier than that, its application in homes is still fairly brand-new.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
