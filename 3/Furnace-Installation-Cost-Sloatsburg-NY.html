<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
