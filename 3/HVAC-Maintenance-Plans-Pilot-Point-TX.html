<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>

The 2 operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
