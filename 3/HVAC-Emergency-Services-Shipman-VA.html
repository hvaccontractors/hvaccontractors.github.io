<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Shipman VA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
