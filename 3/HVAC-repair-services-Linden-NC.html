Poorly located outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets.

<p>A radiator is the part of your lorry that keeps the engine cool and secures it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to remain tidy - always.
