<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
