<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
