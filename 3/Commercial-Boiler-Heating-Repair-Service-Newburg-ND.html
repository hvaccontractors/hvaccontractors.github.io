<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
