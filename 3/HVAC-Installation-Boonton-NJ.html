<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are damp or wet structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are animals and household plants.<p>

This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
