The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>
