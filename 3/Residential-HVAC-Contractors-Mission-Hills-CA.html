<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home.

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
