<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
