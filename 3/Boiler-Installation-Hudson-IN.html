<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Demand warms up during the summer and winter when consumers need their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives.<p>
