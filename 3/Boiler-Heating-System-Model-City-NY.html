<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.
