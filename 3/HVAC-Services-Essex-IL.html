<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and repaired extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
