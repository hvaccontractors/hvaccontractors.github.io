<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
