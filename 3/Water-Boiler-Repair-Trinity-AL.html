<p>The very first thing that you will actually have to install will be the air handler, which will can be found in your central heating unit installation set.

In this case, the control system is very important to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
