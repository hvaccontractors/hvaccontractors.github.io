For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors.
