<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually performed. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the exact same to be real. These examinations exposed that proper ventilation is very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
