<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products.

All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
