<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
