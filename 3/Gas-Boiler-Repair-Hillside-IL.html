After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
