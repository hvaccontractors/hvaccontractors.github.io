<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your house appropriately.

So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which normally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
