Every maintenance job may need completely various steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Setups can also vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. Sometimes, completely new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
