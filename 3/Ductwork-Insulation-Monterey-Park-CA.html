Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
