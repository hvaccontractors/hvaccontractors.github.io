<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
