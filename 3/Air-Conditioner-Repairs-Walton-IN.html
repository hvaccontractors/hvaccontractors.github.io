Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
