<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is determined utilizing the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the appropriate SEER rating for your location, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling units produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
