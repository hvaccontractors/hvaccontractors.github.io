<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
