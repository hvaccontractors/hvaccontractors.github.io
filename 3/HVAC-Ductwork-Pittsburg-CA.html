Permeable materials, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in surprise or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
