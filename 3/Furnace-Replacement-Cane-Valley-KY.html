<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
