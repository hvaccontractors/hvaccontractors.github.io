My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c won't have the ability to cool your home appropriately. These are simply a few of the factors that you require to consider when shopping for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will substantially affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
