<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
