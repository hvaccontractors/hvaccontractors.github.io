<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient.

Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found simply a few feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer reputable and constant heating and cooling.<p>
