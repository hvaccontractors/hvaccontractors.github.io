<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
