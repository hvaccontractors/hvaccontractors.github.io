<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
