<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
