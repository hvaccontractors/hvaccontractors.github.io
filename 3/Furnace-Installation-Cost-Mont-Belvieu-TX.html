<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
