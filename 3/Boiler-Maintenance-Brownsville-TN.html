<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.
