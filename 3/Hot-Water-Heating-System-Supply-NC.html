<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>AC Replacement in Supply NC</h3>
<p>It's a truth that a brand-new furnace for your house is among the more considerable expenses associated with home ownership. However, it ought to also be seen as a long-lasting investment. All of the current heaters are much more energy-efficient than those set up even 20 years earlier. So, while it may seem like a short-term larger expenditure, a brand-new, more energy-efficient home heating unit will more than likely save you money in the longer-term by reducing your yearly energy costs.<p>
<p>When you are searching for a Seattle HVAC team you can depend upon, turn to Bob's Heating & Cooling. As relied on and highly-skilled experts working with clients throughout Puget Sound, we are committed to providing premier heating and air conditioning services completed to your complete satisfaction. From routine maintenance services and straightforward repairs to new setups and large-scale replacements, we are happy to offer comprehensive services tailored to your needs and spending plan.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating system, you might try to find a heatpump more geared towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
