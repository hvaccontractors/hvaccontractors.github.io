<p>These concepts-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate systems have been built in the 4 years since or are presently under construction. The vast majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where cooling is more of an industry requirement, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your home. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your house will not be heated up properly and the system will have to continuously go to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
