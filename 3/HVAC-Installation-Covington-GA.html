<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Covington GA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
