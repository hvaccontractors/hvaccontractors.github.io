<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Manor GA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of houses in cooler climates were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floors, walls and ceilings warmed. In turn, the objects in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
