<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
