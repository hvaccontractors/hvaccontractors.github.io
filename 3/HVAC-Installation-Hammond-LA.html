<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of homes.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC.
