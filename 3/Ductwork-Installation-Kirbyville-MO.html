<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
