<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
