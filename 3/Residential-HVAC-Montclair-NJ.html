After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
