<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
