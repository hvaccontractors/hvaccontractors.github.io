<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
