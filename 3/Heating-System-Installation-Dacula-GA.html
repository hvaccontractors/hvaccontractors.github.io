<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same).

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
