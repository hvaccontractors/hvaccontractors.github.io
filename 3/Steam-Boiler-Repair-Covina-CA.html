<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage.
