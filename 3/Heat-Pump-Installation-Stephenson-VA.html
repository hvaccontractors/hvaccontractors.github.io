<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
