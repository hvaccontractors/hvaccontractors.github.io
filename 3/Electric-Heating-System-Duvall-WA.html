<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heater, you may search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance.

More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
