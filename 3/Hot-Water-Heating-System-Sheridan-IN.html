<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
