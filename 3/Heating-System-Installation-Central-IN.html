Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
