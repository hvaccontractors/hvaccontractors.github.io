<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
