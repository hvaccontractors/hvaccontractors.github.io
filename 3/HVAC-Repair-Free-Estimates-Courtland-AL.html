An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
