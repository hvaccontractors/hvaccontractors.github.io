<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
