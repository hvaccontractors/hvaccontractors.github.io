<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Eastlake Weir FL</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
