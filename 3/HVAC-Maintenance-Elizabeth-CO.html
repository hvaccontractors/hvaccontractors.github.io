<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
