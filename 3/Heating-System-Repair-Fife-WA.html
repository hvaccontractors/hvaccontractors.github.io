"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
