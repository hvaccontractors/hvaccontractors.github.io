<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
