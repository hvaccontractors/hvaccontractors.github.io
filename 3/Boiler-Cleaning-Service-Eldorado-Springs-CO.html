<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
