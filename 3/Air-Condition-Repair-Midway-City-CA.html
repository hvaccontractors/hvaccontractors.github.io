<p>Furnaces resemble cars. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
