<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
