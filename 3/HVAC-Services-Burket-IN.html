<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a simple and effective  technique to decrease ambient air contamination and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
