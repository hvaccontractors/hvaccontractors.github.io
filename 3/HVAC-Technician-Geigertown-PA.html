<p>Furnaces resemble automobiles. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>Similar to homes, the most essential aspect influencing indoor air quality is the existence of pollutant sources. Frequently discovered office toxins and their sources. consist of ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building products; formaldehyde from pushed wood items; other organics from constructing materials, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning activities and materials, washroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and print shops; biological contaminants from unclean ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>

There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had identified the problem area in looking over the costs. He fixed the concern in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I considered fair before he called back, understood what might have caused the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
