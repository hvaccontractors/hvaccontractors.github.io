A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
