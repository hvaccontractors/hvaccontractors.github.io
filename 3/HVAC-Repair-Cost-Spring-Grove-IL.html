<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Spring Grove IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
