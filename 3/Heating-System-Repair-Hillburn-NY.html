<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly located outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
