Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Greenville MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface of a floor heats the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower total temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." To put it simply, in-floor heater supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
