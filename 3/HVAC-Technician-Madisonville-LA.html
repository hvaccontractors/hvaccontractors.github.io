<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
