(See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)

<p>They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for.

<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to resolve the situation right away.<p>
