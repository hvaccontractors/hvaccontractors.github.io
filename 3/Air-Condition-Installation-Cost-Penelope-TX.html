<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
