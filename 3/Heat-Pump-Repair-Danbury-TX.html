If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.
