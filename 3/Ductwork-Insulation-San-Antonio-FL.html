One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface.

The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy.
