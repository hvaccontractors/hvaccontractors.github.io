<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
