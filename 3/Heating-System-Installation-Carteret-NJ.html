<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
