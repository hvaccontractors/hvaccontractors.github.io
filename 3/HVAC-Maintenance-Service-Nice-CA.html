These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step.
