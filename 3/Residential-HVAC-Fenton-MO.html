Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in covert or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding.

Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
