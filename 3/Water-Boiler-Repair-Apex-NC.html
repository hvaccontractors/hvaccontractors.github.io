<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children may have higher direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
