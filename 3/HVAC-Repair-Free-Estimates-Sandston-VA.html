<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
