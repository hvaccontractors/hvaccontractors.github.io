<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Camarillo CA Home Owners</h3>

In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
