<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
