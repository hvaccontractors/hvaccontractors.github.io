<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
