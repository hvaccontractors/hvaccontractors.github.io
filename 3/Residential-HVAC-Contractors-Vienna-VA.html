<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
