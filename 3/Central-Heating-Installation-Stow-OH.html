<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
