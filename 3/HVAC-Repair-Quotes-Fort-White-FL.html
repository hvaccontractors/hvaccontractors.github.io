<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies offer concern appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
