The different surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly connecting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing a little gradually as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life.

Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care needs to be taken to guarantee convenience. In humid or warm environments, preserving thermal convenience solely via natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
