<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
