<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
