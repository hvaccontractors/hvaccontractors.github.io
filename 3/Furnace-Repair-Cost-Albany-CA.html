<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Albany</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
