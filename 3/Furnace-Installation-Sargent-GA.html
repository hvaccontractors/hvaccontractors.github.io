<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Sargent GA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
