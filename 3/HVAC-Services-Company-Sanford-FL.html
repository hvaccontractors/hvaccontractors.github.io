<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the outcome of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or excessive air blood circulation. Office temperatures must be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow must be prevented.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution. If the existing system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
