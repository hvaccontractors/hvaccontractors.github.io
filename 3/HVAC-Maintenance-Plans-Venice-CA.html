<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
