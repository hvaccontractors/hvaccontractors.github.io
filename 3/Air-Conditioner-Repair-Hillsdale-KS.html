If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
