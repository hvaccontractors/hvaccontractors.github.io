<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
