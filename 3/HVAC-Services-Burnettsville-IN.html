<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, infants, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
