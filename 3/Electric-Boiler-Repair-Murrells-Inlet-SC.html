Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as a lot of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
