<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day.

He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
