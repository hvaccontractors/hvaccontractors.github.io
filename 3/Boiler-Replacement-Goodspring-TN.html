<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.
