<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing security at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
