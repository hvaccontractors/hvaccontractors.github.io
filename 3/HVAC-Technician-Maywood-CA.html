<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain because they just partly remove the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a reliable means of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
