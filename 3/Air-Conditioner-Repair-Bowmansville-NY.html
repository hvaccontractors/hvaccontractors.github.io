<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
