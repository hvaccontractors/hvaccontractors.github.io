<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Esmond IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
