<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps track of energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that might avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
