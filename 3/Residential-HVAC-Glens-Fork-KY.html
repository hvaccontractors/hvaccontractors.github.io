<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three methods listed below may be appropriate.<p>
