<h3>Air Condition Repair in Ellendale TN</h3>
<p>Do you need to change or repair part of your house's HVAC system? With those warm Washington summer seasons and chilly winters, it is very important for your home to be equipped with a high-performing heating and cooling system throughout the year. Whether you require an evaluation, repair, installation or maintenance for your HVAC system, you can count on the specialists at AAA Heating & Cooling to do the job right.<p>
<p>The faster you get in touch with Aire Serv, the earlier we can solve your central heat and a/c concerns. In addition to residential and commercial cooling and heating services, our local groups use other services, including carbon monoxide gas and smoke detector installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality services such as air filtration services and installation of humidifiers and dehumidifiers.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
