<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
