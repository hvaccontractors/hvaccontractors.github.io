<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
