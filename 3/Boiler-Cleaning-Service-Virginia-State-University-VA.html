<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The capability of organic chemicals to cause health effects differs greatly, from those that are extremely hazardous, to those with no recognized health impact. Just like other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health result will depend on many elements including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory system irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory problems are among the immediate symptoms that some individuals have experienced soon after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health effects happen from the levels of organics normally found in homes. Numerous natural compounds are known to trigger cancer in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are understood to trigger, cancer in human beings.<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man pertains to your home he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
