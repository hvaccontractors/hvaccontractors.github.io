The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable.
