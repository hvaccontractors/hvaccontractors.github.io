This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
