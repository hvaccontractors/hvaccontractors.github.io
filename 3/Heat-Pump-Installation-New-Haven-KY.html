That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
