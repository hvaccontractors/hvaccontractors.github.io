<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Midway Park</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
