<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
