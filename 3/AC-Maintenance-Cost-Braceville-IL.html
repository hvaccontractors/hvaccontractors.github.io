<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your home, and if it establishes cracks which leak, they require to be fixed. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse outcomes. Your house will not be effectively cooled, and your energy bills will go up.
