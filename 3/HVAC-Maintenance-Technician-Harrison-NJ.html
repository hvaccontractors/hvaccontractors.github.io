<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
