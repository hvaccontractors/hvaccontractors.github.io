<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had found the problem area in looking over the costs. He resolved the concern in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about fair before he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
