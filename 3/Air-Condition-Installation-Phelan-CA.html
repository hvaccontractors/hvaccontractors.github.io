<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Phelan CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
