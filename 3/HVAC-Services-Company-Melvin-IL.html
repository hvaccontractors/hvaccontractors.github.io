Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
