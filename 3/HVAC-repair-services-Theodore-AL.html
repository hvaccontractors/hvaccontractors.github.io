<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Theodore AL</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were very expert, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied exceptional, tailored, attentive, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, efficient and engaging. He plainly and completely discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my wife and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the first go to due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
