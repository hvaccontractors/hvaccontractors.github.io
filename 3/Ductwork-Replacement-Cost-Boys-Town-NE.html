<p>Current Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements completely by offering an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
