<p>As an experienced HVAC specialist, we suggest you have your systems examined and routine maintenance performed two times per year, as soon as in the Spring (before cooling season) and when in the Fall (prior to heating season).

Keeping what is most likely the most crucial and pricey system in your home (heating & cooling) effectively maintained will assist keep your biggest financial investment of your life in excellent shape.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Even after carrying out these jobs to increase the effectiveness and durability of your Seattle HVAC system, you should contact an expert to take on problems rapidly when they occur and perform thorough maintenance once a year or as needed.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
