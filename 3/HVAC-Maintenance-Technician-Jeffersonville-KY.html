<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Jeffersonville KY?</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it significantly difficult for your lungs to work appropriately, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
