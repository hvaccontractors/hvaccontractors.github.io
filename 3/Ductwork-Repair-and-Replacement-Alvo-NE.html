<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>

<h3>Heater Repair in Alvo NE</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
