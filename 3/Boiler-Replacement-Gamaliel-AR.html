<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
