But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy intake and temperatures in shops to save money on expenses (particularly during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an appropriate range that could avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a number of special features that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For instance, property owners may wish to look for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter requires to be altered. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to lower energy expenses even more.
