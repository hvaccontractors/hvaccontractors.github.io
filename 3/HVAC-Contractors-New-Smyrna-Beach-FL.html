High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
