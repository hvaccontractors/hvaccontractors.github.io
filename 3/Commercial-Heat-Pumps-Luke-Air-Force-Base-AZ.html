<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
