<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary risk of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall. More severe than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
