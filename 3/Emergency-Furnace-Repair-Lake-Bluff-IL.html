<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the cause of the problem, it's a good early treatment to attempt. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never utilize a power washer for this-- it can harm the fins. The following are guidelines; constantly describe your owner's manual. Note: Always switch off the power before cleaning the unit.<p>

<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioner smells bad, there might be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To lower pollutants, we recommend setting up sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are created to remove the smallest particles from the air.

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Lake Bluff IL</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps ought to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)
