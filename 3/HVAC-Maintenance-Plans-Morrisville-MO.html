<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
