<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
