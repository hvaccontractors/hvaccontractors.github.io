<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>To safeguard member of the family with asthma or to minimize the possibility that somebody in the house might establish asthma, the house needs to be inspected for possible indoor asthma activates.
