<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
