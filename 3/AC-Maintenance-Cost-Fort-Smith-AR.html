These calculations take into account things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heater. Radiant heating systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heaters, for something.
