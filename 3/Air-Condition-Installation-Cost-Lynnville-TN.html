(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
