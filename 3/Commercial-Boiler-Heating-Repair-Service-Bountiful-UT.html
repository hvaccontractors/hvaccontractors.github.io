<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
