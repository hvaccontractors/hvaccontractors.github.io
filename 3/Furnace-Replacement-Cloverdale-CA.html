Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).
