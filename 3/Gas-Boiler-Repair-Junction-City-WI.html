<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Junction City WI</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
