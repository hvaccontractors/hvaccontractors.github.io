<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
