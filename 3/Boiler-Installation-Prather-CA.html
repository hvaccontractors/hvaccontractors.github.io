<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>It is also suggested for residents of Redmond to have access to heating systems inside their homes. During the winter, heating systems supply sufficient heating power to houses in the neighborhood. The average daytime temperature highs throughout December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s. Temperatures will drop below freezing at night, and heavy precipitation is common during the winter season. When correctly installed and well maintained, heaters provide enough heating power to Redmond, Washington houses.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
