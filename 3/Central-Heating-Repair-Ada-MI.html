What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
