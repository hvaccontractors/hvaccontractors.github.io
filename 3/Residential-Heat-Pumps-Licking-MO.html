<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
