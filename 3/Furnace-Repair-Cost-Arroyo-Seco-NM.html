<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Essentially, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
