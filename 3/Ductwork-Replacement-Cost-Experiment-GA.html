Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
