<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey discovered.

And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
