<p>Some sources, such as developing materials, home furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release pollutants more or less continuously. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the house, release toxins intermittently.

High pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after a few of these activities.<p>
