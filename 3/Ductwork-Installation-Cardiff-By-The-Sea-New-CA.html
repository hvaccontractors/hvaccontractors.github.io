<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer contracts.  The so called reliable companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night outfits. I know due to the fact that I tried to work for them. I stop since 90% of them are criminals. They stroll in with or without a contract and start selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a consultant to confirm the so called issues and solutions. 9 out of 10, I examine are completely wrong.<p>
