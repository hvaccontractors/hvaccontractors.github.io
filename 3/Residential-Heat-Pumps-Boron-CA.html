<p>I have been using them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
