<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers.
