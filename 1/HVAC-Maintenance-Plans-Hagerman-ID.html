<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Area control involves moving the pollutant source away from occupants or perhaps transferring prone residents.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all situated in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roofing or on a concrete piece next to the house's structure. This type of a/c also is utilized in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the home's outside wall or roof to connect with the packaged ac system, which is typically located outdoors. Packaged ac system often include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This combination of ac system and central heater removes the requirement for a different furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>Before cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is necessary to re reduce the energy and evaluate load of the home. A more energy effective house will not only decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility bills, however it will greatly improve the convenience of your home.

Standard enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps.
