<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Frankfort</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
