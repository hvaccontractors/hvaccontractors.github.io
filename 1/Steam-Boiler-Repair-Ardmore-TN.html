He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
