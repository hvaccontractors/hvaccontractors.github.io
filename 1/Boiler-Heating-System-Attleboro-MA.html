<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
