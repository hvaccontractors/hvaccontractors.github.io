<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
