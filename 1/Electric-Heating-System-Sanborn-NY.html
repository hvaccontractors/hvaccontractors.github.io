<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house.
