<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
