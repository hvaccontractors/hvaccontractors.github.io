(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys.
