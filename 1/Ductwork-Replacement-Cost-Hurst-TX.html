<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Hurst TX</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
