<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

If the system is too small, then your home won't be warmed adequately and the system will need to constantly run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
