<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can afford, numerous Seattleites need to find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
