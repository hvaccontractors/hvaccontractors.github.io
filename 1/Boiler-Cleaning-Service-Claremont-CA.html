<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities.
