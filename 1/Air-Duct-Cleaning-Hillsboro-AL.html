<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Hillsboro AL</h3>
<p>Nobody should have to handle the trouble of setting up central air by themselves. No matter where you are in the installation procedure, we can help by addressing any concerns that you have, fixing problems that you have actually been fighting with, and thus making your central air conditioning installation as pain-free as possible. Call us today, and find just how much simpler your central air installation can be.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
