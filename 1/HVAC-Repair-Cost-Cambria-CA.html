<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers.
