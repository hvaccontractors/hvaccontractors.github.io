Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
