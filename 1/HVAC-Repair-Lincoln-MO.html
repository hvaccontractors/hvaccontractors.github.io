<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
