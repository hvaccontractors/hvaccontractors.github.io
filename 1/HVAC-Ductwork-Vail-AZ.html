<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
