<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also cause duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT an excellent concept. You will not conserve any money and will end up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.
