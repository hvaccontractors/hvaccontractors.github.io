It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
