<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
