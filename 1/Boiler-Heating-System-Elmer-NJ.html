<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter.
