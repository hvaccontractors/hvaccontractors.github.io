<h3>AC Repair Cost in Bent Mountain VA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
