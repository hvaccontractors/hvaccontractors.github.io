<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Lexington IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
