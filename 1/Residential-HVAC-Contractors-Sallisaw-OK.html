<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
