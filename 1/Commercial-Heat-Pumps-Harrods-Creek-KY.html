<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
