<p>While people invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and occupants until just recently.

<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry out several days after the suspected water occasion, mold development is believed within wall cavities even if it is not instantly noticeable. Through a mold examination, which may include harmful inspection, one must be able to identify the presence or lack of mold.
