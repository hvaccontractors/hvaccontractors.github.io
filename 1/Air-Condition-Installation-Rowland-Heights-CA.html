<p>We take a look at clues before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
