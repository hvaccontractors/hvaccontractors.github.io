Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
