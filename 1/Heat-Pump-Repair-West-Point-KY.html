<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
