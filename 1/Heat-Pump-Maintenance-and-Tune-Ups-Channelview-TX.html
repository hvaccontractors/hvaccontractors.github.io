<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Radiant heat offers a number of distinct advantages over forced air heating unit. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to stress over duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heating unit types. Sending heat through solid objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
