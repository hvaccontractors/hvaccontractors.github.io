<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Ridgedale MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
