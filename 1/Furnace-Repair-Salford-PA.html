<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
