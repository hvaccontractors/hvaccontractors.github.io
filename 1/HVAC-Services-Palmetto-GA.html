<h3>HVAC Supply in Palmetto GA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
