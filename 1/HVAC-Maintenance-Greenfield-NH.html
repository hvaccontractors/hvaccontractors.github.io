Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up.
