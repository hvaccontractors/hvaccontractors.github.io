<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
