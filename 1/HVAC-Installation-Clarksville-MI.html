<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem.

A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
