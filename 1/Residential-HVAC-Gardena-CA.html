<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short biking in really cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the very low temperatures.

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
