<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

Since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground, it safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
