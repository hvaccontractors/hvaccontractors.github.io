<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
