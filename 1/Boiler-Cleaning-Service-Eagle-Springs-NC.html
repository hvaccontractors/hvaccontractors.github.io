<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Eagle Springs NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
