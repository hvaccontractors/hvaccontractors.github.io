<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
