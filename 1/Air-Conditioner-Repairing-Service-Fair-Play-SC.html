The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has actually resulted in the advancement of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
