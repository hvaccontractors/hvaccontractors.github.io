<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>First, in terms of benefits, heating the entire house or structure from one unit makes things much easier logistically, and the isolation of the heating unit from the living space is a perk for some house owners.

<p>Similar to a lot of home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary commonly based upon the size of the house.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
