<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively.
