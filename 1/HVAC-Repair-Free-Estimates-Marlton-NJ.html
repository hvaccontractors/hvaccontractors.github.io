<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
