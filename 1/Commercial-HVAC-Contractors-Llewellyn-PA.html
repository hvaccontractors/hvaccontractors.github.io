An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
