<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking, home products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating units.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to keeping a correct temperature.<p>
