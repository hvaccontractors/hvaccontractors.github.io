<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
