<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
