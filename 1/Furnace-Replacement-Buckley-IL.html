<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your house, and if it develops cracks which leakage, they require to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy expenses will go up. Setting up new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
