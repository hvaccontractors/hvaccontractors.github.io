After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In other words, in-floor heater provide a various mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
