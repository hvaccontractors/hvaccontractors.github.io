<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.
