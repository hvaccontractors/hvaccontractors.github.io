The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
