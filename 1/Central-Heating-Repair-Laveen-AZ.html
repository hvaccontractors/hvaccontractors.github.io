<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
