He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
