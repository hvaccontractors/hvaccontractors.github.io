<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
