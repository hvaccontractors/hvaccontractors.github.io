<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly enjoyable individual to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to RESOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
