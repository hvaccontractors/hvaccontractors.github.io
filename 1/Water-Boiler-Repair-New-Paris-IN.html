<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
