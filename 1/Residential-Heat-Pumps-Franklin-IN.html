<h3>Ductless AC System in Franklin IN</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>When installing radiant heating, you must offer severe idea to the type of flooring covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well due to the fact that it performs and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the room, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, use a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>
<p>In some cases an old a/c unit needs to be replaced for cost, efficiency, or other reasons. However, choosing an a/c is never ever a one-size-fits-all situation.
