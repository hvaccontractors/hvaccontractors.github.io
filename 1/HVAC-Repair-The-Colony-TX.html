<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in The Colony</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

An expert technician will inspect the thermostat during the annual maintenance to guarantee the real temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches.

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
