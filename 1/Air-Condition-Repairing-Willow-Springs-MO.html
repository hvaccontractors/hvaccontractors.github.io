<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
