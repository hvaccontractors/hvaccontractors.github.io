<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
