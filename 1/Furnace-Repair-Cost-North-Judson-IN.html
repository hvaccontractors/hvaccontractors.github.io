<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
