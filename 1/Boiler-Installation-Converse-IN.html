<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
