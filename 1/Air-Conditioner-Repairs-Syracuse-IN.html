<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
