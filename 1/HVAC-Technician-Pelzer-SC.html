<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Pelzer SC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
