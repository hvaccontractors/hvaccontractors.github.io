A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
