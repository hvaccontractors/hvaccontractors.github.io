He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
