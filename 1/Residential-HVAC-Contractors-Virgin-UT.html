<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this.
