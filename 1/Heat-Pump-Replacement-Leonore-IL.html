<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
