(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
