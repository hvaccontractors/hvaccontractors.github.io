<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
