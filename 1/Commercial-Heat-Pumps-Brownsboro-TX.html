Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings.
