<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last job is to check the system to make certain it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat.
