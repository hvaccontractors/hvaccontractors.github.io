<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.
