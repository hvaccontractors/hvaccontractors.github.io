<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in covert or seldom accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
