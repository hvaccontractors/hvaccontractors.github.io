<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can require to select items that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes wet.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.
