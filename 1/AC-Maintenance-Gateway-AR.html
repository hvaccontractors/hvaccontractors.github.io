<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
