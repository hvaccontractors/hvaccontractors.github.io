<p>We needed two check outs - Jake came out first and was enjoyable and extremely knowledgeable and polite. Grant came out a couple days later and was nice and likewise experienced to speak to. They both did a great task. Sabre's office personnel is very practical, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly advise.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy easily, specifically if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air.
