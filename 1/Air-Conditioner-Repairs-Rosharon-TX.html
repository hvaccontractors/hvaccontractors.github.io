<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems.

<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
