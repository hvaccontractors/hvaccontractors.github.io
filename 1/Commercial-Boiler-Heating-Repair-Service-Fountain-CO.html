<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
