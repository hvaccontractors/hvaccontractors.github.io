Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
