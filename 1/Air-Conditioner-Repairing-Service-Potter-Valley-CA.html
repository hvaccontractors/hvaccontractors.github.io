<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
