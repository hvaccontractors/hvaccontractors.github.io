An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
