<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners.
