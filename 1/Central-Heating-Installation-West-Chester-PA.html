<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
