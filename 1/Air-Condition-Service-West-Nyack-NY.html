An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
