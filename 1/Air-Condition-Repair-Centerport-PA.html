<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies every month might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, a lot more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating costs from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
