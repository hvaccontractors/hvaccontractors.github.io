<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
