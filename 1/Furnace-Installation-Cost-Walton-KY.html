<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
