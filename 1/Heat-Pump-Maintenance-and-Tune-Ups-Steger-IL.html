<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
