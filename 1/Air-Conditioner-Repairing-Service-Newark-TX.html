<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system.
