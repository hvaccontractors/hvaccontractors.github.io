<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

There are a variety of humidifier choices that will help keep consistent humidity levels and develop comfortable living conditions in your home.<p>
