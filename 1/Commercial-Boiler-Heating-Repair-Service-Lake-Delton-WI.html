The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
