<p>Info offered in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures constantly evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be developing as an outcome of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
