Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
