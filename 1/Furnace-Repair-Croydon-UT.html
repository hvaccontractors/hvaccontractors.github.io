<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>

One of the primary locations where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
