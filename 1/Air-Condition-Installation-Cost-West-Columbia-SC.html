<h3>Air Conditioning Service in West Columbia SC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the concern and fixed extremely quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If your furnace quits working, start by calling RJ Heating. We typically find that a basic repair or adjustment is all that's required to help it run properly again.

<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in hidden or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
