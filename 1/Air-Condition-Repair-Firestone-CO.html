<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Firestone CO</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
