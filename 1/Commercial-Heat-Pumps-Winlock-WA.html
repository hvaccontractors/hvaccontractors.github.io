<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially since we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same duration.

The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
