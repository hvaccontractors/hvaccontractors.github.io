<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
