<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
