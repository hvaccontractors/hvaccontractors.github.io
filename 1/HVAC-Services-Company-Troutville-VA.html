<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heatpump should be without all clogs and particles. Blockages can block the circulation of condensed water and trigger wetness accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, irregular temperature regulation, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to ensure all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>
