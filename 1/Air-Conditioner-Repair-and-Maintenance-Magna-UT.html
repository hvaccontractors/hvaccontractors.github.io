<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
