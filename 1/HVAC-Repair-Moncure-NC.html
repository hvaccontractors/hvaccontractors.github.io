<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
