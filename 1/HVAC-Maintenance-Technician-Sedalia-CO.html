<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>
