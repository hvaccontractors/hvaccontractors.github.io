<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>In Poteau 2019 figures, the Bureau of Labor Data reported a typical wage of $21.89 per hour for HVAC professionals, or $45,540 per year based upon 40-hour weeks.
