<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and work environments matters, particularly given that we invest most of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>York HVAC systems are considered among the very best brand names especially since they are known for their value rates. The average cost to install a YORK a/c with a 16 SEER rating would cost around $3,200 to install. The more effective designs such as the York YXV which boasts a 20 SEER would price out at around $4,420 to install. When sound is a genuine concern, York AC units are also understood for being very quiet and are an excellent choice.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
