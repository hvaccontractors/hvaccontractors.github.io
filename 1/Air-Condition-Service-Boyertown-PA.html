<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
