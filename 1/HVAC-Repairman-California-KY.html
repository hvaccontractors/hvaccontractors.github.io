<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
