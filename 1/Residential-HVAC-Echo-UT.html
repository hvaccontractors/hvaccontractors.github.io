In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%.
