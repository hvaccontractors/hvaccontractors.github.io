<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>

In other words, in-floor heater offer a different mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
