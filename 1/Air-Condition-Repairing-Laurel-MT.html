<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
