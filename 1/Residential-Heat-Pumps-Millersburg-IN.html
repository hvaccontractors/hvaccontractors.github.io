<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Millersburg IN</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
