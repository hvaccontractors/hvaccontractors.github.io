<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
