<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, just including refrigerant is not a service. A skilled technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant.
