<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can fight unstable energy prices, reducing your heating costs by approximately 45%. Advancements in heating technology have actually resulted in systems that contaminate less, enhance convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace typically has an AFUE of about 65%.
