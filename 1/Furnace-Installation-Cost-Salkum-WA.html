<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
