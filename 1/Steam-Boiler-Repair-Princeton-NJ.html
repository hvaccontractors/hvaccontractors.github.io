<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Princeton NJ</h3>
<p>At Taylor Heating & AC, we provide a variety of innovative cooling and heating services that will help you lower your bills and maximize your home's comfort. Our highly qualified specialists will provide preventative repair and maintenance for your current heating and cooling systems, or suggest and set up the perfect new system for your house.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
