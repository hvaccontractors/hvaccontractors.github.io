Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power.
