<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<p>Certain instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and location the signs take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can impact a person's ability, health, and convenience to work. It can consist of temperature level, humidity, lack of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards however it does provide guidelines about the most common IAQ office problems.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death.
