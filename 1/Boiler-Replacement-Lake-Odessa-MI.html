<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter.
