<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
