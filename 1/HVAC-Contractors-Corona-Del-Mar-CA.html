<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
