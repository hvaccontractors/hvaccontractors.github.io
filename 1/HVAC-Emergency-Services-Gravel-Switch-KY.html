<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered simply a few feet below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by eliminating heat.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
