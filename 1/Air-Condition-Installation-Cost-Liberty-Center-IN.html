<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Liberty Center IN</h3>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
