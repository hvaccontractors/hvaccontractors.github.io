<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
