<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Knoxville TN</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
