<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Pipersville PA</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile homes, apartment or condos, high-rise condominiums, row housing, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), appropriate purification, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
