<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Palisade CO</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Many indoor air pollutants originate from the cooking area. Gas stoves release harmful contaminants, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide.
