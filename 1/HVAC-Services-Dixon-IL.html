<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
