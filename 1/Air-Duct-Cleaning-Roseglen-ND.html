<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
