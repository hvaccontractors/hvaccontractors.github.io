<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Alief TX</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
