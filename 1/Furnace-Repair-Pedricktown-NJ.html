<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
