For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a really advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
