<p>All Points Heating uses home air conditioning, air conditioner installation, air conditioning system maintenance that deliver trustworthy, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion products from auto exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heaters, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not appropriately vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may result in nose, eye, and throat inflammation; tiredness; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins which sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
