<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
