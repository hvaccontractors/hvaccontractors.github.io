<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources.
