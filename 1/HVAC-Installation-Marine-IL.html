The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
