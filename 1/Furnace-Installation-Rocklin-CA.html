<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
