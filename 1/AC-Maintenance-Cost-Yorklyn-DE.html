The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
