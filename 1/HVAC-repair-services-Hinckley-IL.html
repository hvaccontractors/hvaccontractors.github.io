<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns.

Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
