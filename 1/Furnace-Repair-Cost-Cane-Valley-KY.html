<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
