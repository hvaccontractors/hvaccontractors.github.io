<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>For pollutants aside from radon, measurements are most suitable when there are either health signs or signs of bad ventilation and particular sources or toxins have been determined as possible causes of indoor air quality problems.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
