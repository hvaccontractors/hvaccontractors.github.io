<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
