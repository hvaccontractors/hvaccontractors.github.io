<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
