<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>While contaminants commonly found in indoor air are accountable for lots of damaging results, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce particular illness. Individuals also react really in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is required to better understand which health effects occur after direct exposure to the typical toxin concentrations found in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
