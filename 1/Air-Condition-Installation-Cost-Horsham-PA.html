<h3>AC Compressor in Horsham PA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Some health effects can be useful signs of an indoor air quality problem, specifically if they appear after a person relocates to a brand-new residence, remodels or refurnishes a house, or treats a house with pesticides. If you think that you have signs that may be related to your home environment, discuss them with your physician or your local health department to see if they could be caused by indoor air contamination. You might also want to speak with a board-certified allergist or an occupational medication specialist for answers to your questions.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Horsham PA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
