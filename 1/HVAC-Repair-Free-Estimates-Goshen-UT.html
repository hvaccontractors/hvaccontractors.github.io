<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Goshen UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
