<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>Firstly, The after hours answering service agent, John, was really respectful and professional. Secondly, Gracion W is a timely, experienced technician. He was at my house within the time he provided me, fixed the problem while describing the issue then stayed several minutes to ensure it was working properly. The problem was repaired in a matter of time that I've never seen before while being a property owner for 10 years. I also recommend one of the Protection Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to save cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
