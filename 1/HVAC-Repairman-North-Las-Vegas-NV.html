<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
