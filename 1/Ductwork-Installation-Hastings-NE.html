<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
