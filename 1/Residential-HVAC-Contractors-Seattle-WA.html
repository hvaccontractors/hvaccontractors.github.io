<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to change two furnaces in a 8000square foot house.

Only be worried if your house is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in a specialist to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
