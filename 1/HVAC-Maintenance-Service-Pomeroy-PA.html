<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
