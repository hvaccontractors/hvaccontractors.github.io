<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet likewise contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

If your house already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most economical central air conditioner to set up.<p>

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer reliable and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or typical home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
