<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
