Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
