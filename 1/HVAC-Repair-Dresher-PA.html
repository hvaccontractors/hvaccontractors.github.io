<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work.

<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
