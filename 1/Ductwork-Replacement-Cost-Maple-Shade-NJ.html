<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively.
