<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your automobile.

In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Biola CA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
