<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins.

Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
