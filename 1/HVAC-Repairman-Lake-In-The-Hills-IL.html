<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
