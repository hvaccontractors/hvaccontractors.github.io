This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
