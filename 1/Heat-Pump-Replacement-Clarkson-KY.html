An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Clarkson KY</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
