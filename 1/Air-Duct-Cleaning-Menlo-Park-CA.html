<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Menlo Park</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Luis, Melissa and Herbert were all a fantastic assistance and really professional! Quick response time and kept in contact the whole time. Really simple finance procedure, excellent communication and excellent service! I don't generally do reviews however this bunch makes every star they have.
