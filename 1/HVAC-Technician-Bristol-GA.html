<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
