<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
