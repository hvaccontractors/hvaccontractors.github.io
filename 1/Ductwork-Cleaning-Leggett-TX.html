<h3>AC Repair Cost in Leggett TX</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
