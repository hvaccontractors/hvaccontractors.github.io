<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them..

Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
