<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop a/c are performance-tested to conquer severe or uncommon roadway and weather. Numerous basic systems break down after simply 4 hours of severe vibration testing, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate supplies long lasting strength while long copper lines reduce vibration and, for that reason, noise too.

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be better to change the entire system.<p>
