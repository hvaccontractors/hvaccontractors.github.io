<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
