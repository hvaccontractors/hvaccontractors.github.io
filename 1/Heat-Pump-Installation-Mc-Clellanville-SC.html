<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and building residents may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning items, construction carpets, activities and furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants.
