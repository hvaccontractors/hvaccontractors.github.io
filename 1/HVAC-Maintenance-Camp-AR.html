<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>First, know that a bulk of your central air conditioning and unit cost will originate from the system itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger homes. As you saw recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down sooner than anticipated or your regular monthly energy expenses will increase.
