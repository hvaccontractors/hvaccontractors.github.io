<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors.

Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air).
