<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
