<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
