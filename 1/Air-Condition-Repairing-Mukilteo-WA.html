<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
