Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or extreme wear to the exterior. They may advise that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to make sure adequate airflow around the unit.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
