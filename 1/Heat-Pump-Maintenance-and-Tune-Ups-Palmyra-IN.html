<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, electrical energy or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
