<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work efficiently.

This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Staunton VA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
