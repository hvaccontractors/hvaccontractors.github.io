<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Wellford SC</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the air conditioning system smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioner's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Picking the best size air conditioner is an important part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why buying the best size air conditioner matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up wasting money and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
