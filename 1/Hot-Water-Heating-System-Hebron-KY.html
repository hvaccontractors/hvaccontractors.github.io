<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
