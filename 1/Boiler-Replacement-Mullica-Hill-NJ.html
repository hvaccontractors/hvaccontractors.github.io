<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids may have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
