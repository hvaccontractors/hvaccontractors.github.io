<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
