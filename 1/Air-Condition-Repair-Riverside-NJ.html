There can be a severe risk from the cumulative effects of these sources.

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, stability Energy was fast to respond. They appeared the next day and changed 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
