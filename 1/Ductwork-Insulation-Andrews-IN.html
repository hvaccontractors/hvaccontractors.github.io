<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
