<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
