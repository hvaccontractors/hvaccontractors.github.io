<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
