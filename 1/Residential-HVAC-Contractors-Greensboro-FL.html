<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
