<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to lower the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air.

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration technologies are ending up being more typical as offered solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages. Adoption of these technologies, nevertheless, has not been widespread, as consumers stay mostly oblivious to the impacts of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might become blocked, minimizing air circulation circulation, quality, and volume. They also may end up being locations for molds and germs to grow and be dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be effectively preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
