<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Ductless heatpump are great for additions since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

The companies were not made aware they belonged to a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or techniques utilized. The EPA research study recommended and controlled methods utilized on a smaller sized number of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these studies were performed, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>

Call a pro-- you've got more serious concerns if it blows again.<p>
