<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same duration. Generally, SEER provides more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>
