<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
