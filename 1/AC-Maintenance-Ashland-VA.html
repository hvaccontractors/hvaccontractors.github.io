<h3>Picking the Ideal Ashland VA Business For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes far more extreme with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
