<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried.

However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
