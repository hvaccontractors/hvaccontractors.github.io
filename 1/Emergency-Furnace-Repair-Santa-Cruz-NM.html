<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective.
