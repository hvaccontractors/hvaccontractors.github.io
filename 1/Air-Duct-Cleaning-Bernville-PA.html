<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
