<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
