Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
