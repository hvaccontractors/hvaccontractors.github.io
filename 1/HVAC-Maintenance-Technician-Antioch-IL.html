<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and workplaces matters, particularly considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95).

(He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
