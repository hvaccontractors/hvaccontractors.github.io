<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
