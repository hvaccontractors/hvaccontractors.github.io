Due to the fact that they heat surface areas and not the air itself, in-floor heating unit are not vulnerable to this issue. Furthermore, given that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, registers and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heater can minimize the amount of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
