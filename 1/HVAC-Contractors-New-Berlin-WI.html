<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Fundamental enhancements usually include adding insulation and air sealing procedures.
