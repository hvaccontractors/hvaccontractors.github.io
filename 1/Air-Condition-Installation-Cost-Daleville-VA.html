<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
