A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Huntingdon Valley PA</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the a/c to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. The technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or extreme dirt if the individual parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
