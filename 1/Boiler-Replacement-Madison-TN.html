<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
