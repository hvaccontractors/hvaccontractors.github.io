<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
