<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
