<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation.
