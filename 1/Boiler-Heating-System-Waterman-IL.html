This is normally utilized in a second or third-floor  area and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
