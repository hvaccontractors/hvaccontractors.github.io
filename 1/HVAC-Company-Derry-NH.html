<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Derry NH</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
