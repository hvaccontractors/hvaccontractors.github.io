<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
