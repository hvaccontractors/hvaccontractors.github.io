<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. Only be concerned if your house is not warming up.

<p>Some health impacts might show up soon after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified.

<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
