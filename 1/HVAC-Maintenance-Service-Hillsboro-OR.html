Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
