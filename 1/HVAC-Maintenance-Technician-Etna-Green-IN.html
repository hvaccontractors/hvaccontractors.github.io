<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the right temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to contact an expert to repair the unit and examine.<p>
