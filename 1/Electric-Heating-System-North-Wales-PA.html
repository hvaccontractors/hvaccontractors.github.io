<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
