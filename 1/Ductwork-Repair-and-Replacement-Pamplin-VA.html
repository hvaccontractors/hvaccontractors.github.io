<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
