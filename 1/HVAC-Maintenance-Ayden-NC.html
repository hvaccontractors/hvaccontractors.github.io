<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
