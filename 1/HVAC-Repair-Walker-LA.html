<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in houses.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
