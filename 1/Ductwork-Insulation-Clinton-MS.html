<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
