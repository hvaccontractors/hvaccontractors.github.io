<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it may be wiser to replace the whole system.<p>
