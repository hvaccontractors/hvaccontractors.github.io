<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
