<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
