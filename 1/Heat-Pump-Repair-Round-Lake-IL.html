<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
