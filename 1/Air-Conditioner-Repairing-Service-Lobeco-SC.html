<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stale air may also be an issue when ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company must check measurements of humidity, temperature level and air flow. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to ensure it is working according to requirements for constructing usage and tenancy) ought to be performed. A structure walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings might be valuable. Leakages require to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with germs or fungi and need to be eliminated, likewise.

For instance, in schools asbestos requires to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Before installing any brand-new heating or cooling system in a house, it is needed to re lower the energy and examine load of the home.

Numerous fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ.

Sometimes, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas with time) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>
