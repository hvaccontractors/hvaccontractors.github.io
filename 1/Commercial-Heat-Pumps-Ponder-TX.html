<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical method of minimizing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will lower however not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they construct up due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such big quantities of toxins. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most efficient way to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking there.<p>
