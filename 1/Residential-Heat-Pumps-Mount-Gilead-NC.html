<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
