<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and readily available source of energy.<p>
