<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
