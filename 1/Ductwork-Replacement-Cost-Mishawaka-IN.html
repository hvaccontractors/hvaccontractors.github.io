<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Mishawaka IN</h3>
<p>Before you pick a contractor, consider quotes from a minimum of 3 to five respectable contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no client grievances have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate. Compare the different furnace performance ratings suggested by the private contractors to pick the design and system that best suits your energy needs. Remember that energy-star rated equipment will save you cash in the end but might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
