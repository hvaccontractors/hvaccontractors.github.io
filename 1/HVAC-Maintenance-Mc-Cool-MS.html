<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
