<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
