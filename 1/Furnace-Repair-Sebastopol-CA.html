<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
