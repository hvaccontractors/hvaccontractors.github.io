<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
