<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Outdoor impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Specialists recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
