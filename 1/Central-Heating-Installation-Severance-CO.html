<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps must also be required to reduce pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures should not be undertaken till these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Its special function is the presence of one primary external system that connected to numerous indoor units. Such systems may be the right solution for preserving the microclimate in numerous workplaces, stores, large home. Simply few of outside units do not worsen the visual appearance of the structure.
