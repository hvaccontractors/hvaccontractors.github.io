<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
