Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation service entirely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living.

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to supply threshold alerts. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm.

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
