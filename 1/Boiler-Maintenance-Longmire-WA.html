<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Longmire WA</h3>

<p>Many elements impact IAQ. These aspects consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the structure.
