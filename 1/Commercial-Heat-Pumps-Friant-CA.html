<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
