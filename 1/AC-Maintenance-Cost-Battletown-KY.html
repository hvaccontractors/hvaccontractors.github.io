<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office complex such as hospitals and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as cars, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
