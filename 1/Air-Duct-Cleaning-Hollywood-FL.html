<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
