<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed combustible or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are offered through the removal of heat. Heat can be gotten rid of through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is used either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a totally free cooling system which uses pumps to distribute a cool refrigerant (typically water or a glycol mix).<p>

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy.
