Unclean filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
