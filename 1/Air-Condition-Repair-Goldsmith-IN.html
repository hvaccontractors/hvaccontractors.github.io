<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation. A thoroughly crafted organisation prepare for an HVAC company is the first step to handle those lulls and peaks so your profits stay healthy year-round. If you didn't create a heating and cooling service strategy when you started your business, it's not too late to develop one now, or to offer your original strategy an update.<p>

In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter when every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
