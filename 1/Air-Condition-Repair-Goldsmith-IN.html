<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC experts like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation.

During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
