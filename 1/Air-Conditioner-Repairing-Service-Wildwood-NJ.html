<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
