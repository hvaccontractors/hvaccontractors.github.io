<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
