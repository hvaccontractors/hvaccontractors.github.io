<p>Though it might be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
