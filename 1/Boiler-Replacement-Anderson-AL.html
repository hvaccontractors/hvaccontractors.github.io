<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
