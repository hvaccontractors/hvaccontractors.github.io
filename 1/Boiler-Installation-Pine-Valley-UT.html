<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

This ought to do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
