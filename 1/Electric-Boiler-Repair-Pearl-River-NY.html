However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an acceptable variety that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
