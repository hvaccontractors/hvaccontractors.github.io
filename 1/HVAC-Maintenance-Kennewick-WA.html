<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
