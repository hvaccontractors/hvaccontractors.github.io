<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is necessary to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
