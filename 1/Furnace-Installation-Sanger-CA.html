<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Sanger CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system.
