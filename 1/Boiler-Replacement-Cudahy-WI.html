If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outdoor air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common indoors.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
