<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
