<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Since approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness benefit. Ductless heatpump are great for additions since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
