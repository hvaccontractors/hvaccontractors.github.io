<p>Heating systems resemble cars. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
