<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
