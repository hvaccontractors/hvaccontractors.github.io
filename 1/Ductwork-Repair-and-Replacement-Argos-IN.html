<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
