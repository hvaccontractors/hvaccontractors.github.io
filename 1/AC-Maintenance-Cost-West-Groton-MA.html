<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in West Groton MA</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements.
