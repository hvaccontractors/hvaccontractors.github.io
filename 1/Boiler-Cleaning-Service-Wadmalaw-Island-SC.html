<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

A more energy efficient house will not just lower the cost of a brand-new system and energy bills, but it will significantly enhance the comfort of your home. Prior to we design and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements normally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures.
