<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively.

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
