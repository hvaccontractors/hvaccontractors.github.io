<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
