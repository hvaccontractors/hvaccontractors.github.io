<h3>Electric Heating in Cerritos CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
