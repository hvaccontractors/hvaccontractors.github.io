<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.

If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
