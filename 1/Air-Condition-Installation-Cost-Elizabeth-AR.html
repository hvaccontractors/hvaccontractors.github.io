<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and houses matters, especially because we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Ac system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
