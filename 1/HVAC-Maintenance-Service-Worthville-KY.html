<h3>AC Maintenance in Worthville KY</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate situation & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from beginning to end were really expert, polite and the work was really efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>We can suggest the best unit for your requirements if you require a brand-new heating or air conditioning unit set up. Why pay extra for a system that over- or under-performs when you can get a best fit? And whatever HVAC system you have, we can help keep it running strong with our preventive maintenance strategies. Our techs are familiar with how your system works so they can find the subtle changes in efficiency that might be signs of bigger difficulty down the roadway.<p>
<p>A lot of companies use third party service warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the very best minimal service warranties in the business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed warranty. Due to the fact that these service warranties lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and essential mechanical components, you can feel confident knowing you've selected the very best furnace and a/c for your home or business.<p>
