<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Manassas VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
