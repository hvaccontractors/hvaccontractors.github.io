<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
