<h3>Ductless AC System in South Milford IN</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us for that reason.
