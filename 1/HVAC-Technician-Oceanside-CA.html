<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Oceanside CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
