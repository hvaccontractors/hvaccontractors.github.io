<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
