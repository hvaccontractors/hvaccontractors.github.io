<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
