<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heaters have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
