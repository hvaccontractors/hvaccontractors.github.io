If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's probably your issue.
