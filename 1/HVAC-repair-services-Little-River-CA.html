<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
