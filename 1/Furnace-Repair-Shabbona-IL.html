<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, however lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.)

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
