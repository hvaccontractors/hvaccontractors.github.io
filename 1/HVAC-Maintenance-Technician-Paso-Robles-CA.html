<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly effective, depending on the design you buy. Among the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating choices.

Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
