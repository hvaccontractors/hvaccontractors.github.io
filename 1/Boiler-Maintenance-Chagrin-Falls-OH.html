Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
