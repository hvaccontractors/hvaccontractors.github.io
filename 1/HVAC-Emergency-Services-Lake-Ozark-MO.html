<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
