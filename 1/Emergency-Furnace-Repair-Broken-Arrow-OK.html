<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
