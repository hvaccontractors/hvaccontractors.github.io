<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Helmsburg IN</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins released by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that contribute to indoor air contamination. Such aspects consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
