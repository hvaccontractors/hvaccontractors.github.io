<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the whole workplace or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
