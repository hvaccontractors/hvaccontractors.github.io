<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Maywood NJ</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
