<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Elk Grove Village IL</h3>
<p>While contaminant levels from private sources may not position a significant health threat by themselves, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that many people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
