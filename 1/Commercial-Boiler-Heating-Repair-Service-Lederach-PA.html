<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor.
