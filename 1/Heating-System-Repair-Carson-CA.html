<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Carson CA</h3>
<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to focus on the time and place signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the area, for example, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
