<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>To set up a safe consultation or visit with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing technicians in your area in an online search.

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
