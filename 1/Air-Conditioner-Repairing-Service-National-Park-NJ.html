<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
