<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>No matter what sort of heating system you have in your house, you can save money and increase your comfort by correctly preserving and updating your devices. But remember, an energy-efficient furnace alone will not have as great an effect on your energy expenses as utilizing the whole-house approach By combining correct equipment maintenance and upgrades with advised insulation, air sealing, and thermostat settings, you can save about 30% on your energy bill while decreasing environmental emissions.<p>
