<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
