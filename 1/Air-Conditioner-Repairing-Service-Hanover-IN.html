Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
