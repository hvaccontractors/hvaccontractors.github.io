<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
