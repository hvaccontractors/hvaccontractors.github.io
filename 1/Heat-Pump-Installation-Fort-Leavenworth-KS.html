<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
