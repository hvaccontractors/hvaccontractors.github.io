<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
