<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are responsible for numerous harmful impacts, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are required to produce specific health issue. People also respond extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to better understand which health impacts happen after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations discovered in homes and which occur from the higher concentrations that occur for short time periods.<p>
<p>It is not useful to design a universal guideline fit for all in terms of exposure and health because immunity varies significantly from individual to private. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a 10 year study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were gathered throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type consisted of both residential and commercial. Most of samples examined were evaluated positive for germs and fungis.<p>
