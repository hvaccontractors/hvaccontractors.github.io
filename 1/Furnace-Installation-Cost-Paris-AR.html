<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However much of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
