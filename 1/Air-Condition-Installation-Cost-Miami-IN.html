<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, submarines, aircrafts and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
