<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
