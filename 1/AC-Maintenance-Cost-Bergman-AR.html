This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
