Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
