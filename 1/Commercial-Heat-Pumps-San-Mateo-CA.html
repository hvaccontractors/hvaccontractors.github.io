<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years back and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

The results of CO exposure can vary considerably from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
