<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

(He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>Picking the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Forest Falls CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out.

So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
