<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns.

Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open.

The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up.
