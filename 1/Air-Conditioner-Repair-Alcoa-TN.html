<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided terrific customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends on the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, consisting of installation. Geothermal heatpump typically need excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
