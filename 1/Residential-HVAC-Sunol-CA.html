<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Sunol CA</h3>

From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
