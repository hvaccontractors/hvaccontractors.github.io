<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
