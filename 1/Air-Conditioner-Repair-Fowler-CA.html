The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
