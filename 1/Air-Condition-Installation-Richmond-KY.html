<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention.
