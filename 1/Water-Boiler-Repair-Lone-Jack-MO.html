Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
