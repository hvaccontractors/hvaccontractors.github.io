This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

Think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas range or variety. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
