<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
