<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
