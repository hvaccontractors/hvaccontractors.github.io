<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
