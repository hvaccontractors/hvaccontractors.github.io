<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people.
