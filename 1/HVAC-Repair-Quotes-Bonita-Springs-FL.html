<h3>Repair and Care for Bonita Springs FL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Many people don't know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A constraint in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leak. There are various locations an obstruction can happen. One of the primary locations where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
