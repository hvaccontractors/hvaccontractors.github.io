<p>Gas heating systems do feature some drawbacks. The most significant disadvantage is also the result of the combustion procedure. This procedure emits exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide gas, which have to be vented to the outside of the home. Carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, and is highly harmful in greater concentrations. A malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting problem might put your house's inhabitants in real danger because of this.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Gradyville KY Home</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
