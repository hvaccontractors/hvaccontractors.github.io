<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in California City</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
