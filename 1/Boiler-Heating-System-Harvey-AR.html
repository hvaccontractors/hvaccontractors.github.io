<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
