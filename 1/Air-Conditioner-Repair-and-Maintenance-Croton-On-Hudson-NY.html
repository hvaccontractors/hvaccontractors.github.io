<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house.
