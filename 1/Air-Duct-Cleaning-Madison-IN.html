This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to pollutants during cooking. Incorrect modification, often indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue.
