<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
