<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>When deciding which of the best AC units they should set up in their homes, there are a couple of primary things that house owners will desire to take into consideration. It really depends on what you value the most in a leading brand name central air conditioner. The major aspects for many house owners will be the overall cost to set up the best air conditioner brand names, life expectancy of the AC unit, service warranties offered, energy effectiveness (SEER rankings), and size of the unit you need for your home's square footage (TONS) to efficiently cool your house.<p>
