CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources.

<p>First, in terms of advantages, heating the entire home or building from one system makes things easier logistically, and the seclusion of the heating system from the home is a benefit for some house owners. The system can be used to supply warm water in addition to environment control. In addition, locals can change temperature levels in different parts of the house by closing vents in ductwork or by utilizing space or area-specific temperature level controls. You can also set a schedule with central heating systems. In general, central heating provides a decreased environmental impact.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>A lot of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that permit property owners to manage the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in home to save cash on the energy bills and guarantee the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will examine the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to make sure the actual temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to check the thermostat's efficiency or assess the entire HVAC system if there's a distinction in the temperature.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to preserve and understand.<p>
