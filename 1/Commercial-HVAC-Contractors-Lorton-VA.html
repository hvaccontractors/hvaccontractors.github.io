Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air.
