<h3>Radiant Heating System in Midvale UT</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>

Practically all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, won't rust and is available in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, heated floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a major renovation task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heating unit is a suitable solution for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
