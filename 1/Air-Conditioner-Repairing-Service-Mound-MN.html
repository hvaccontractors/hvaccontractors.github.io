Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
