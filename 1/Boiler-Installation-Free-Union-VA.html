Many common building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently advised instead.<p>

Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
