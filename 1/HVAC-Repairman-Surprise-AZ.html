<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Radiant heat uses a variety of unique advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

A house heated up by a glowing system will warm up faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
