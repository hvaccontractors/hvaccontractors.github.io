To make sure the system you select is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to figure out the exact type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These computations consider things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
