<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
