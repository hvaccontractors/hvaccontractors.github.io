<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the greatest energy consumers in your house, so property owners who might be shopping for a brand-new furnace must thinking about replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to conserve money and help the environment. The typical furnace lasts between 15 and twenty years, so you're making a considerable financial investment in your house. Spend wisely by finding out as much as you can about readily available choices.<p>
<p>Consider possible results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
