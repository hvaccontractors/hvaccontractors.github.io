<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
