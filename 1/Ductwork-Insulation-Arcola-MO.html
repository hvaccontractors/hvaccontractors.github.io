And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors.
