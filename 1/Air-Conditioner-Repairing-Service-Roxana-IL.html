The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
