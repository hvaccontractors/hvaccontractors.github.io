<p>Heaters are like cars. As they age, you can change one part only need another part changed or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Furnaces sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below zero night.<p>
