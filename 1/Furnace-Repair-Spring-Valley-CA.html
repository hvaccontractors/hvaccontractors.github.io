<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, especially considering that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
