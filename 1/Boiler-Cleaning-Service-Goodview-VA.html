<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
