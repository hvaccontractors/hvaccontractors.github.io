<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
