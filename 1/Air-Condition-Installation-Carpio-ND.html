<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floors.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
