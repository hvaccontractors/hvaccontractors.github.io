<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative ought to request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
