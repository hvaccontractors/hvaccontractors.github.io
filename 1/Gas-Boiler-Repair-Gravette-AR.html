<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance.

When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
