<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
