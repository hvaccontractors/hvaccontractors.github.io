<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
