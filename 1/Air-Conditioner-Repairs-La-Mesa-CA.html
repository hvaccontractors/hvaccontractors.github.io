<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
