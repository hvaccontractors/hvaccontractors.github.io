<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
