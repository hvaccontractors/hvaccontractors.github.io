<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
