<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent space furnishings that build up dust, specifically if they can not be cleaned in hot water. Since vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite irritants and other biological pollutants, allergic individuals should also leave the house while it is being vacuumed. Utilizing central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also be of aid.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
