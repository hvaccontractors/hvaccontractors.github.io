<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>There is no easy response, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better service. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one action specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, causing cracks and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
