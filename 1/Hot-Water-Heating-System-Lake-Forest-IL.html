<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often vital to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Review of this data might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
