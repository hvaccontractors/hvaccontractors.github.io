My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement.
