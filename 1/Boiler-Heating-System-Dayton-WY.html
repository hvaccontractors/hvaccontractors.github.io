Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
