<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
