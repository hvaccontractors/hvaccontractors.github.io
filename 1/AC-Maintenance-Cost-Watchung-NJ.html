<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can change one part just require another part changed or repaired next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heating systems incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air.

<p>You might update to the highest efficiency equipment available and still not feel easily cool on hot days.
