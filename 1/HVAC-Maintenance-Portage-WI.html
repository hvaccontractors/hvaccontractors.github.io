"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced.
