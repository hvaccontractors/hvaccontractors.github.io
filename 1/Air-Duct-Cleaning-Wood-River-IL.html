<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Wood River IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the difficulty area in looking over the costs. He fixed the concern in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, knew what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
