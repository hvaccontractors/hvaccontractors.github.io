<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Dellrose TN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
