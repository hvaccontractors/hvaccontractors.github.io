<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other items.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house is located, the local region's climate can alter drastically. A house located in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would need a much larger heating capability as well which will impact expenses. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by HEAPS.<p>
