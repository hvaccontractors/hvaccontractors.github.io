<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
