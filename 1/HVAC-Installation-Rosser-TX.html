<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
