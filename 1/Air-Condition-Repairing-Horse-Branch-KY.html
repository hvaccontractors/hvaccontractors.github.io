<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Horse Branch KY</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
