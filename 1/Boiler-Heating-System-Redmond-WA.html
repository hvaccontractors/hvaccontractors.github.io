<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may see undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
