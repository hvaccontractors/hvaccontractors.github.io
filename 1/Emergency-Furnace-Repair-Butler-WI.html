<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for several years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a brand-new system. New heating devices is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right now, not to mention the cash you'll save on repair costs.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
