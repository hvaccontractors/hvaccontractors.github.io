<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Toccoa GA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
