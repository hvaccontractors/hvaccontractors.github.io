<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP).
