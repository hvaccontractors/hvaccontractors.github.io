<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Clarendon Hills IL?</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
