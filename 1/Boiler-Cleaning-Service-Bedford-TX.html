<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Bedford TX</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
