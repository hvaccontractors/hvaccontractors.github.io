<p>Simplify your services, make more services profits, and supply an incredible customer experience. To ensure the unit you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we do not simply change it with the very same size system you currently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.
