<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
