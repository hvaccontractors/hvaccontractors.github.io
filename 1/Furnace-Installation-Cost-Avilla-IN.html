<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
