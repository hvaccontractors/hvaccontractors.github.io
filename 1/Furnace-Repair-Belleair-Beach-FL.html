<p>When trying to figure out how often I should change my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how frequently your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one a/c filter need replacing regularly.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
