<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
