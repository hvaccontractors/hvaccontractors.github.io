<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Improper change, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
