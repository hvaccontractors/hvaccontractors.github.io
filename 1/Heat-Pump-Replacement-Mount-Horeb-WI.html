You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
