<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States."

<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
