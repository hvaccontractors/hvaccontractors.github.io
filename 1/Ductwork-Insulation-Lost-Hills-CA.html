<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
