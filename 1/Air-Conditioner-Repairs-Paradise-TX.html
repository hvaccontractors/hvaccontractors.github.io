<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be inspected a minimum of twice per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a service or merchant to do the installation.
