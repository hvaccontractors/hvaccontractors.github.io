<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
