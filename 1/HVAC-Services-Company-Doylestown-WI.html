<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
