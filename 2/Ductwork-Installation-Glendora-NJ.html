<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
