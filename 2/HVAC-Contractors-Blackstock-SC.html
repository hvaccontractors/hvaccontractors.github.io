<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Blackstock SC</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is filthy or clogged Before attempting to repair any issue, require time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan".

Contact an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>

Incorrect modification, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you acquire a new gas range or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
