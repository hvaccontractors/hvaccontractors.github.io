<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
