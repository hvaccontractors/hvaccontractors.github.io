<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years.

The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
