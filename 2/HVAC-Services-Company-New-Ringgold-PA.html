<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can stay and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up till many years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought house from job sites.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at New Ringgold PA</h3>

If we had the chance to make informed options, and some are dangers we may decide to avoid. Indoor air pollution is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
