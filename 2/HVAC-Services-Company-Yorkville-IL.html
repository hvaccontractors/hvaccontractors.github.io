<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Yorkville IL</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is dirty or clogged Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Get in touch with a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
