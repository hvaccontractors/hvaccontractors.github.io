Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
