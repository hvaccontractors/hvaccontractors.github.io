<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden seem higher than regular, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system.

The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be greater, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heating systems. They need a tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. In general, they offer an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
