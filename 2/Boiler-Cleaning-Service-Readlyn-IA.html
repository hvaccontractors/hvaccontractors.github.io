<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Readlyn IA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
