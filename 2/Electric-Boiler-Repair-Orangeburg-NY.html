<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.
