<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
