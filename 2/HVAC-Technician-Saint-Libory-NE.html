<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this.
