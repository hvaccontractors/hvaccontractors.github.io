PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>
