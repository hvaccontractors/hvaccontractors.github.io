<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is wintry. Likewise, if the ac system smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
