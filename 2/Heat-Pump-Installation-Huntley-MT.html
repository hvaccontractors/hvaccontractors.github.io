<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
