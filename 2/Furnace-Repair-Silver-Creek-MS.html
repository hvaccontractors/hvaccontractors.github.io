<p>These concepts-- and determination to suffer through the heat-- might already be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate systems have been built in the four years since or are presently under building and construction.

Hazardous exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

This means that cost savings are still recognized throughout the cooler duration. In fact, a desuperheater decreases winter season water heating costs by approximately half.<p>
