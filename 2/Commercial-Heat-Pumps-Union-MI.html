<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Union MI Home Owners</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the house. If the individual parts are in proper order, the technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
