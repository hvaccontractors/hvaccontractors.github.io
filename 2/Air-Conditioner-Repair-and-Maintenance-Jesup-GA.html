<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Jesup GA</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is filthy or stopped up Prior to attempting to fix any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, call a knowledgeable technician.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
