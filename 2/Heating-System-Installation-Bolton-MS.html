<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
