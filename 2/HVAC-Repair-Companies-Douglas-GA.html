<h3>Air Condition Repair in Douglas GA</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by most public water products, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a specialist technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
