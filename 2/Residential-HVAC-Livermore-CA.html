<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
