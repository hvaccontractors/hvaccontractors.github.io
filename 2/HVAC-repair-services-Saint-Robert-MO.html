<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
