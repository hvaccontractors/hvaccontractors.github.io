<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as developing materials, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch contaminants more or less constantly.

<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
