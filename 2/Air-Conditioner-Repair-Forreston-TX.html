<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential problem to house owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution research studies have determined a number of pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards generally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with traditional devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new building (houses typically use between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
