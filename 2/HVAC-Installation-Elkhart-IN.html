I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again.
