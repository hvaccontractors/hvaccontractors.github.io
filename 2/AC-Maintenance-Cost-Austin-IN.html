<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Think about prospective results of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the maker's directions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
