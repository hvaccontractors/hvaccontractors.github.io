<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of units include a set that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and safe fit in the window opening. And for extra support, specifically for larger air conditioning system, consider acquiring a steel support bracket and install it to the outside home wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
