Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
