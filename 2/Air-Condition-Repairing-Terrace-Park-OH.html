<p>Use or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of reducing exposure to indoor air pollutants, likewise will reduce but not get rid of direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to substantially lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. As a result, the most effective method to minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
