<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
