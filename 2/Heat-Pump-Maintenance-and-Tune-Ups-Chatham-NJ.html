<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Company in Chatham NJ</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
