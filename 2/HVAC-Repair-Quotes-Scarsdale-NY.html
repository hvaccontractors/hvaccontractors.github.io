<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
