<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
