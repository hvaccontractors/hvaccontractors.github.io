While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

<p>New heaters are significantly more efficient than those of 10 or more years earlier, cutting expenses by as much as 30%.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
