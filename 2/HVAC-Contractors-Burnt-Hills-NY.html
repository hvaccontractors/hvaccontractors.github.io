<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
