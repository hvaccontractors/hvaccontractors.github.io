In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building.

<p>If you operate in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you may unwittingly bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil extremely close to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by highways and roads might be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to going into the house. Alter your clothing before you go house and wash these clothes independently if you work with lead in your job or a hobby. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which adheres to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
