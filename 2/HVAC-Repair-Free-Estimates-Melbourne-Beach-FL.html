The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
