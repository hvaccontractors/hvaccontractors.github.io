Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
