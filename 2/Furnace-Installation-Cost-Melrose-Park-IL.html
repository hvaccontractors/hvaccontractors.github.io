<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump generally require excavation to set up, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
