<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Waynesboro VA?</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are really knowledgeable and professional. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was certainly reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
