<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace includes inspecting the suggested connections as well as temperature and pressure determines.

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.
