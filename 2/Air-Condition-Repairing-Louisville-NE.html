<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
