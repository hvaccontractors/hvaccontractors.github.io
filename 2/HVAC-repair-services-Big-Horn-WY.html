<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
