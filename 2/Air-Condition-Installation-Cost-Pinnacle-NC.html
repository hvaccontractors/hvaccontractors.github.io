<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from an organisation or retailer to do the installation.

A voided service warranty won't do you any good need to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and hire a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
