<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
