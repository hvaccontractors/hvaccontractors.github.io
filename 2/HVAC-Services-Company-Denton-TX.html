<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
