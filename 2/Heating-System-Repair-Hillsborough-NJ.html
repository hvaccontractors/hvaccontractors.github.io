<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits.

<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Hillsborough NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
