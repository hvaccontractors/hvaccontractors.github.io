With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, making it possible for an enhanced worth proposition for a broader set of clients.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
