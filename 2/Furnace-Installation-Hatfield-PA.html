<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and harden-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
