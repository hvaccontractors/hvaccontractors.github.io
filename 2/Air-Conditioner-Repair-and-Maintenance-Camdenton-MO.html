<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>

If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose confidence, it's time to call a professional. Likewise, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you have to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
