<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by offering a professional quote with options, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile flooring heating system too soon, before the mortar has treated, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere properly, and may void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the compound had cured. If you do not follow their directions, and mortar manufacturers might decline warranty coverage.<p>
