The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Since they're cheap, an ethical company does not exploit low-cost labor opportunities simply. Economical craftsmanship is usually substandard workmanship, and it never ever helps a company build long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
