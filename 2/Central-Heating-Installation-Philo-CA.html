<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
