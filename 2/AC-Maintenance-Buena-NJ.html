<p>New air conditioners usually range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score suggests higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy costs.

It's not always about selecting the model with the greatest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can assist.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
