<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
