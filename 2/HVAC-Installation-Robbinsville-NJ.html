Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
