<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated concerns-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three tactics below may be suitable.<p>
