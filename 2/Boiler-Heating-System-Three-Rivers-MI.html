<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply consistent and reliable heating & cooling.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
