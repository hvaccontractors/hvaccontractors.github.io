<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
