<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, family pet hair and other particles cause problems like failure to supply sufficient heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement choices range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That may be a very pricey dirty-filter diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This kind of cleaning work ought to be done in a routine basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, inspect our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
