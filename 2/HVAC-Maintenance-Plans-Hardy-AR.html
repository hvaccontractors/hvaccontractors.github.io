Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
