<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
