This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
