<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs.

Only be concerned if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to employ a professional to inspect and repair the system.<p>
