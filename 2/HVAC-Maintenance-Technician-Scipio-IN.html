<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures vary, but frequently consist of really hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive steps consist of changing regular warm water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing facility design layout, eliminating faucet aerators, and regular testing in suspect locations.<p>
<p>A/c unit can develop a great deal of water because they get rid of wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
