<p>These concepts-- and desire to suffer through the heat-- may currently be changing.

The vast majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where air conditioning is more of an industry standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
