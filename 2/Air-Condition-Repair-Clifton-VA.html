<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Clifton VA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>There are some more serious threats for HVAC workers that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be dangerous.
