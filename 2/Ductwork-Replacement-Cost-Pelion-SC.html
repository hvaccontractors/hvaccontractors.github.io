<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I must change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into factor to consider.

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>I have ended up being fairly adept at researching items on line prior to buying them. However I don't find that there is a central location for browsing info about the "true" value of house HVAC systems or perhaps I need to state a truthful evaluation of these items.
