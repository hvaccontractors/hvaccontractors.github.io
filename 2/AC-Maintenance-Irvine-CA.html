<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Irvine</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post forecasted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>
