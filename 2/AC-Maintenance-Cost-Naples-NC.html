"Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and home plants.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
