<p>Air pollutants can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>

The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
