<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
