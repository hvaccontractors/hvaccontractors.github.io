<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
