However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>When company is less hectic, it can be the perfect time to brainstorm creative techniques for promoting your HVAC company as well. For example, you may try participating in home and garden shows, trade convention or other kinds of event marketing. Or perhaps you'll introduce a contest, a free gift or a special financing plan to improve equipment sales. You can formalize them as part of the marketing technique you detail in next year's service strategy if the experiments pay off.<p>
<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated professionals perform much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
