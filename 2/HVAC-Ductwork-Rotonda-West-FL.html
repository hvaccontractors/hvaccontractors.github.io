<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
