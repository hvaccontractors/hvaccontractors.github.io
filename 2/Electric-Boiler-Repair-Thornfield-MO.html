<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.

People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
