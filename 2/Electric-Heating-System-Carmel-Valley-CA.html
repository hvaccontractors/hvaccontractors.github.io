<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Carmel Valley CA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is vital to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be checked a minimum of two times each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have actually been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
