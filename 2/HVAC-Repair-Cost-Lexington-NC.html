<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not harmful, but might end up being harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms might also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole office or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
