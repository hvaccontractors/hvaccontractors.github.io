<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Services in Griffin</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating system) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
