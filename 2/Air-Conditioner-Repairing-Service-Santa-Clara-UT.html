<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Santa Clara UT</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bryant air conditioning brand name is another excellent brand that needs to be thought about when discussing options for HVAC replacement. Bryant is a well recognized brand that uses AC units, heat pumps, and gas furnaces. It is reasonably priced and is a sis company to a few of the other leading brand names on our list. Bryant air conditioning unit are often made with the same quality parts as a Carrier brand HVAC system. It would cost around $2,624 in installation costs if you were wanting to set up a mid tier AC replacement with a 14 SEER Bryant Preferred 124ANS air conditioner.<p>
