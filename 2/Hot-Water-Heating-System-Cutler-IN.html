<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Structures are developed or planned to react actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

We may discover it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the methods utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply advice to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
