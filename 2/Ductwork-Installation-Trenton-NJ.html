Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with fungis or germs and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy.

To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
