<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health signs is an efficient, correctly designed and operating ventilation system.

<p>Air conditioners can develop a great deal of water since they get rid of wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
