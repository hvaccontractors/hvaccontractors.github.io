<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
