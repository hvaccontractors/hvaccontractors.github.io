<p>Measurement procedures are being established and demonstrated to examine structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures range from sophisticated tracer gas techniques used mainly in developing research efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by developing operators.

The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has led to the advancement of an important database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
