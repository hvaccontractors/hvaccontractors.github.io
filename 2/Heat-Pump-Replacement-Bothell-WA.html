<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can take full advantage of performance and offer longer long lasting house heating.

The decision to change or repair is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides higher energy effectiveness and includes service warranty protection.<p>

<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, eye, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain.
