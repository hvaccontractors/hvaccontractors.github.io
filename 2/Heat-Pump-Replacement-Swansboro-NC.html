<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal.

I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
