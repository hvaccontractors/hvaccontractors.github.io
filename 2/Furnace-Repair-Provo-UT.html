<h3>Which Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Provo UT?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
