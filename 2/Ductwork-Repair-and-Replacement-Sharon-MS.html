<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Sharon MS Home</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
