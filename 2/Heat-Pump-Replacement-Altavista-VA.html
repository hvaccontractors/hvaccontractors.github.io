<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized.
