<p>While toxins typically found in indoor air are accountable for many hazardous effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are essential to produce particular illness. Individuals also respond extremely differently to exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research is needed to better understand which health results happen after direct exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in houses and which occur from the greater concentrations that occur for short amount of times.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
