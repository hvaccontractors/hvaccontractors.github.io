<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Stephenson VA</h3>

They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
