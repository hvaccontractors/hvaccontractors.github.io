<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Woodburn IN</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website.
