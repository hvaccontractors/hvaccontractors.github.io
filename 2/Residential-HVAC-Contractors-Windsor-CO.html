<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
