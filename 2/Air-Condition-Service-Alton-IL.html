<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Alton IL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
