<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements entirely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
