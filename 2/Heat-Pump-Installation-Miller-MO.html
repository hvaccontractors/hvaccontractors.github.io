The typical summer temperature level to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER ranking for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
