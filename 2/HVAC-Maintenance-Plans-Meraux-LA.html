<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
