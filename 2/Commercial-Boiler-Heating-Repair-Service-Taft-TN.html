<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
