<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided.
