<p>Sean was really handy. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
