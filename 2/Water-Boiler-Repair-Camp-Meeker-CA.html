<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
