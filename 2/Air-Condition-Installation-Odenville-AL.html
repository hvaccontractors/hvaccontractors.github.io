<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
