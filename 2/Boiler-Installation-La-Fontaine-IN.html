<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
