<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, especially since we spend most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company.

Some companies offer concern appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
