<p>Similar to a lot of home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
