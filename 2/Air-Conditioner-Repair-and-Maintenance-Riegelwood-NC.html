<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms at the same time, however are not extremely energy effective.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
