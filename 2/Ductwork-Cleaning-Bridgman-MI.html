If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process.

According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building."

If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
