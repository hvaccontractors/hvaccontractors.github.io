Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Randolph OH</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
