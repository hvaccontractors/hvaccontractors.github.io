<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds.

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
