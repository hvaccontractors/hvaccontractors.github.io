<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
