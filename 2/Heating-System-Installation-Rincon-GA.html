<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms simultaneously, however are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a luxury item and more like a necessity.
