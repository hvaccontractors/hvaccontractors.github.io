Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will need more energy to cool your house.

A home heated up by a glowing system will warm up faster, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
