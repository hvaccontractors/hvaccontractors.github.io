<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
