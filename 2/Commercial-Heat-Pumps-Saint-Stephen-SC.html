Some effects may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Incorrect adjustment, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue.
