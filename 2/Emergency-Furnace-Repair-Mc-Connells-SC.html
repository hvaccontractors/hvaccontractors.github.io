<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Another impurity of indoor air is outdoor air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma may find being indoors provides the best relief, if the indoor air environment is great. Although cooling does not filter the air, it assists individuals with asthma due to the fact that windows and doors are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outdoor irritants and irritants out of the home. A sudden shift in temperature from warm to cold can likewise an asthma attack.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
