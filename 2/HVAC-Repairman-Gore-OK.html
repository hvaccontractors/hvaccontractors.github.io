We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
