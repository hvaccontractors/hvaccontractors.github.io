<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
