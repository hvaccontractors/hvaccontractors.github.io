Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that should be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
