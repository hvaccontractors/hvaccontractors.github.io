<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
