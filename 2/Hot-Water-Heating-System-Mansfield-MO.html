Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
