<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Walkerton IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We picked getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
