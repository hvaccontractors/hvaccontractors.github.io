<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Summersville KY</h3>

When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue.
