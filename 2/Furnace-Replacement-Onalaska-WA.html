<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs.
