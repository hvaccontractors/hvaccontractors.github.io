<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
