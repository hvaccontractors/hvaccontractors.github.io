<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
