<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch.
