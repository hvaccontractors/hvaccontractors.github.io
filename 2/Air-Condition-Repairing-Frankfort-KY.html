<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
