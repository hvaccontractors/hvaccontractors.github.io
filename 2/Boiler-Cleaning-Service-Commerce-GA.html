<h3>Choosing the Right Commerce GA Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>

If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
