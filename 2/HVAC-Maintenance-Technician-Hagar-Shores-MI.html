<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine.
