<h3>Residential HVAC in Witter Springs CA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
