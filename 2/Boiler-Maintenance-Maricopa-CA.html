<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
