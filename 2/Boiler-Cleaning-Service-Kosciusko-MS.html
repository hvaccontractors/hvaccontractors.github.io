<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system.

Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, given that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
