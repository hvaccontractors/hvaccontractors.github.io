<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Spring Grove IL</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
