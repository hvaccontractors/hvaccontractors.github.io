<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Newry SC</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are moist or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants.

<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
