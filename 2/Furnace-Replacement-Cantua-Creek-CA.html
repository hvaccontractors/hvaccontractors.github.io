<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Underground temperature stays continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power.
