<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
