<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Upland</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But many of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
