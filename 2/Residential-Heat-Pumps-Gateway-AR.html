<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Gateway AR</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
