<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
