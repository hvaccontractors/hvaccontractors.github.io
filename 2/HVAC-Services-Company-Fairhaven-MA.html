<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Ideal Furnace Repair in Fairhaven MA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures should not be undertaken until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
