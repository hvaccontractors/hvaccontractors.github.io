Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside.
