<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate substantial savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
