<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
