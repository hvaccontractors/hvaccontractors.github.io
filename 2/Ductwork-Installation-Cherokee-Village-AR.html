<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Cherokee Village AR</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
