<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
