<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
