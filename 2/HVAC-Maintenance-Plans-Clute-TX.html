<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not typically include lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the house from household pipes that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only method to know. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
