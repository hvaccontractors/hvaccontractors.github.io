<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Citrus Heights</h2>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
