<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
