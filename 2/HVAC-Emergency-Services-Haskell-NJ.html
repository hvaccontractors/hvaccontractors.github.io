<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
