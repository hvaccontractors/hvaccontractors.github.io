<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
