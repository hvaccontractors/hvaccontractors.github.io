<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
