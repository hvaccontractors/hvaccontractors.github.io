<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
