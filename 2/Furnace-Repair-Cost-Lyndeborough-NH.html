<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
