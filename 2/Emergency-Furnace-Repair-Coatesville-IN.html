<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
