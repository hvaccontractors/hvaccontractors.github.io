<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects throughout summers. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up thoroughly prior to chillier seasons start.

<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
