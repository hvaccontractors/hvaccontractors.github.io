<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
