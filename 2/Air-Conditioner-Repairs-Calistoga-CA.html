<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
