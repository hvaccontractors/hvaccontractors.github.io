Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>

Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
