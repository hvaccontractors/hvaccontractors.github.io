<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not restricted to homes. In reality, many office buildings have substantial air pollution sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be developed or operated to provide sufficient amounts of outside air. Lastly, individuals typically have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they perform in their houses. As a result, there has been an increase in the occurrence of reported health issue.<p>
