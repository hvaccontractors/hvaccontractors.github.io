<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, gas or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms.

Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
