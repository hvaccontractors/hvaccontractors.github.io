The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has led to the development of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
