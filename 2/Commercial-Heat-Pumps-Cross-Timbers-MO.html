<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or even transferring susceptible residents.<p>

Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture indoors is associated with a greater frequency of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>More often, however, investigators will need to come to the structure to carry out individual interviews with occupants, to try to find possible sources of the problems, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other structure functions.
