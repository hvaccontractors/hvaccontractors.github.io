<p>Certain instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often challenging to figure out if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination.

Some results may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such factors include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
