<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
