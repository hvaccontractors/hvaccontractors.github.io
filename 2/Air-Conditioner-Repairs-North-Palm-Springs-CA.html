<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue.
