<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Roscoe MO</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>There are several variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such factors include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas released by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
