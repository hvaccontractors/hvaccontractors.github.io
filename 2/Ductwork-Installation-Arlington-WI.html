It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
