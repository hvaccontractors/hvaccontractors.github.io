<p>Generally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
