The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to lower the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
