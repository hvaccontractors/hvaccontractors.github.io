<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Rutherford CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
