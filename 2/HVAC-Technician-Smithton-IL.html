<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic utilized all over the world, including EMV.

<p>Specific kinds of HVAC units are a little bit more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to look at. They supply powerful air flow and are considerably more powerful than standard wall systems and can, therefore, decrease the number of systems needed and this can decrease installation and or replacement costs where several HVAC systems are needed.

They are generally the most pricey choice; nevertheless, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal units hidden with minimal exposure.<p>
