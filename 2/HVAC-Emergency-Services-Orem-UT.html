<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

But if you want your brand-new HVAC organisation to have staying power, you need to step back and commit the necessary time to establishing a company plan.

It's a structure to guide the launch or revamp of your company that you can build upon and restructure as the business evolves.<p>
