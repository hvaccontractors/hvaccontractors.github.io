Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
