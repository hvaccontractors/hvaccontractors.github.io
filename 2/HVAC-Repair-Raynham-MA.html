<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
