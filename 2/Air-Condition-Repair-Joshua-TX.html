<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
