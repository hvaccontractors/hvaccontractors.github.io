<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination.
