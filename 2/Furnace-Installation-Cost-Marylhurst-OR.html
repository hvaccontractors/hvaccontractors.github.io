<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
