Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch contaminants basically continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies launch pollutants periodically.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
