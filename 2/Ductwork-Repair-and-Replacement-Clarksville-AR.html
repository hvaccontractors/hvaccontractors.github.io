<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
