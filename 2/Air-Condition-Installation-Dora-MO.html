<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Dora MO</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The primary step to fixing any issue is identifying what the problem remains in the first place. We waive our diagnostic costs if we find your system needs a significant repair. When we do any repair, the parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts service warranty.
