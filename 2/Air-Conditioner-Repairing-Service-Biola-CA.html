The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
