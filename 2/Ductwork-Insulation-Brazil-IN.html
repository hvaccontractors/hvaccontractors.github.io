<h3>AC Technician in Brazil IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain short biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will merely run more difficult to maintain a warm climate for your house when the weather is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact one of our specialists if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
