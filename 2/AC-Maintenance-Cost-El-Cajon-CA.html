Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
