<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to purchase it. My partner said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
