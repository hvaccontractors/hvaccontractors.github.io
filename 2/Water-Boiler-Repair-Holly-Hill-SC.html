<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has performed.

These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
