<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are typically incorrect for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and disorientation. The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
