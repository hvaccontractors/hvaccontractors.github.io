<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

(He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
