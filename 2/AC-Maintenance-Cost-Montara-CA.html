<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Montara CA Home</h3>

<p>You should get your HVAC system aesthetically examined at least once every year to make certain all the systems are working well. This inspection is an essential element of HVAC maintenance. If you do not get your system examined, you will not see a problem until it quits working in the middle of winter.

Regular inspection and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and lengthens its life.<p>
