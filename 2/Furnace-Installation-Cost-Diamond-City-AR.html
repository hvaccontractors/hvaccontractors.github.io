These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological pollutant. Biological pollutants in the house may consist of mold, germs, viruses, termites, and pollen.

They also can trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Signs brought on by biological toxins consist of sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, lightheadedness, and breathing infections.<p>
