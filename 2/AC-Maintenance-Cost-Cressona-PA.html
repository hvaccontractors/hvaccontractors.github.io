<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

Among the primary areas where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
