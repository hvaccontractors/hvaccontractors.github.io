However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
