There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Ron had identified the trouble location in examining the expense. He solved the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the costs to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
