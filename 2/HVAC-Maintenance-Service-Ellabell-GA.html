<p>The icing issue becomes much more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperature levels.

<p>Given that 1985, the Department of Real Estate and Urban Advancement (HUD) has permitted only making use of plywood and particleboard that conform to defined formaldehyde emission limitations in the building and construction of prefabricated and mobile homes.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
