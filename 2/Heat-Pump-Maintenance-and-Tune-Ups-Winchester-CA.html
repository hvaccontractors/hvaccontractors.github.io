<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration.

The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
