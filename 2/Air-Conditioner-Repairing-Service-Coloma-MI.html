<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
