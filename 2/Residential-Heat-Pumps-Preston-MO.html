<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burnt.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
