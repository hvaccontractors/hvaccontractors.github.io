<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
