<p>Sean was really useful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes dirty and old. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
