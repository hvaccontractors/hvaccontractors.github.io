<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Dhs VA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
