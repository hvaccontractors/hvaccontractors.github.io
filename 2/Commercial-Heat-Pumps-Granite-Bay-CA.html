However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
