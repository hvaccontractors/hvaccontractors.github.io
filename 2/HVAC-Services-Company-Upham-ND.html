<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
