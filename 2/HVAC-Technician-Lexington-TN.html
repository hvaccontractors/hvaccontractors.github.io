<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that many Seattleites will only utilize moderately, however since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive option, however newer systems can be very energy efficient.
