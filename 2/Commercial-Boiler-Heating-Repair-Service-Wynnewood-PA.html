<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
