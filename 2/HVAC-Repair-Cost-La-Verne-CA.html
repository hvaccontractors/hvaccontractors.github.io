<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
