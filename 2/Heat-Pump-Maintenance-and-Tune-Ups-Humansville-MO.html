<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
