<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
