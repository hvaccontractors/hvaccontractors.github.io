<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear greater than normal, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to point out the money you'll save on repair expenses. If your heater is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
