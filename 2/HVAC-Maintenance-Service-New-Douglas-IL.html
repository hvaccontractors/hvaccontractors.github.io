<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your New Douglas IL Home</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
