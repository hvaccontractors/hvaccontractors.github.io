The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units. The absence of moving parts means you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years.
