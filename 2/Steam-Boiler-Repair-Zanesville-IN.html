<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
