<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance benefit. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
