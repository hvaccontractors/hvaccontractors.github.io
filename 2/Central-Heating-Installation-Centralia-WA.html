Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
