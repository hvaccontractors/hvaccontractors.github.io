<p>Some HVAC service technicians offer service contracts to their clients, providing regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems.

<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to toxins from bacteria that can grow in large structure ventilation systems.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
