Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable.

<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out.

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd location and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put.
