Soil by roadways and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to entering the home. If you deal with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes before you go house and clean these clothing individually.
