They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
