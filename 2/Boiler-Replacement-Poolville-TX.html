<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
