<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
