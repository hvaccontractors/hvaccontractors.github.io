<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
