<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Mc Farland CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
