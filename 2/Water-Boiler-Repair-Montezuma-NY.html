<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
