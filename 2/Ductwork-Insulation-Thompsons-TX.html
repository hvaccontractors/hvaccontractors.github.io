<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
