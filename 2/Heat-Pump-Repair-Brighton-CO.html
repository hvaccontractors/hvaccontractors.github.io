<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
