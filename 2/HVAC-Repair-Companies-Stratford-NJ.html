<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing.

ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
