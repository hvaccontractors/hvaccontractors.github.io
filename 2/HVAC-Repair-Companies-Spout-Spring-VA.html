<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
