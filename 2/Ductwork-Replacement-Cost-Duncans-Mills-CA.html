<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Duncans Mills CA</h3>
<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
