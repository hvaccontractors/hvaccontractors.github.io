<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Rustburg VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
