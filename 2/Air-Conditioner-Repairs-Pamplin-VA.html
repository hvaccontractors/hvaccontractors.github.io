<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
