<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes unclean and old.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>

Come to Firestone Total Car Care for an AC service repair prior to any damage spreads.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
