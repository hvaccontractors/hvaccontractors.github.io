<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time.

Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
