<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
