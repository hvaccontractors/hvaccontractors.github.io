<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops ought to be used with fans that send exhaust exterior.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.
