<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.

(Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
