<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Studley VA</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that spends for itself throughout the years, however just if you secure it to the very best of your capability. Luckily, this doesn't need to be a task! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance plan. No matter what make or design of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual examinations, marked down diagnostics, priority service, and amazing deals on repairs and replacements. Pick in between our bronze, platinum, silver, and gold strategies, and we'll provide you with the greatest level of defense and maintenance.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Studley VA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
