<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
