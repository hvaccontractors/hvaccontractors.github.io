<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation company totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months.

<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be placed. A lot of typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific area.

<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
