<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
