<p>A specific air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
