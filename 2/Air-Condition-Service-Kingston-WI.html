Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.
