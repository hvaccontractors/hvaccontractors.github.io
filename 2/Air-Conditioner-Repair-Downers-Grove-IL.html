<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
