Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However a number of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside contaminant, it might function as a pathway to bring the pollutants inside.
