The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space.

<p>Its special feature is the presence of one primary external system that connected to several indoor systems. Such systems might be the ideal service for keeping the microclimate in a number of offices, stores, big living spaces.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
