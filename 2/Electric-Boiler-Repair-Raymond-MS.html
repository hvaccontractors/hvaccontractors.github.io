<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates.

Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
