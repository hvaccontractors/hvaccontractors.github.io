<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
