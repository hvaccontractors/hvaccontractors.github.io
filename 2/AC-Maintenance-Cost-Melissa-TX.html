<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>When setting up radiant heating, you should give severe idea to the kind of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well since it carries out and shops heat.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a really typical repair.
