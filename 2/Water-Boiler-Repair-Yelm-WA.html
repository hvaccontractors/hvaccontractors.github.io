<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
