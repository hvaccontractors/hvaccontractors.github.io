<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
