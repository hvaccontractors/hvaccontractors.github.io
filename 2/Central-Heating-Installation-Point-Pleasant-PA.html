<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
