<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
