<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Stella Niagara NY</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
