<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
