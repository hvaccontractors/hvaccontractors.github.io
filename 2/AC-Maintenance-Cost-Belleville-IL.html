<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
