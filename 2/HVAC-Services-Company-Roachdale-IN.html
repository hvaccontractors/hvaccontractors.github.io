<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas gave us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating unit and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these small however substantial changes in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
