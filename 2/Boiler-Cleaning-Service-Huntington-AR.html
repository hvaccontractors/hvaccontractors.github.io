<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>In a lot of cases, if products have failed to dry several days after the presumed water event, mold development is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable. Through a mold examination, which may include destructive assessment, one need to be able to identify the presence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold remediation might be required. Mold testing and examinations need to be performed by an independent investigator to prevent any dispute of interest and to guarantee accurate results; complimentary mold testing used by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>
