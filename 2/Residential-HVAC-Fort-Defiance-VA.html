<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, up until the required for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
