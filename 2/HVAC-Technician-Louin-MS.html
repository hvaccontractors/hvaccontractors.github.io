<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
