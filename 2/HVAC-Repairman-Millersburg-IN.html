<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
