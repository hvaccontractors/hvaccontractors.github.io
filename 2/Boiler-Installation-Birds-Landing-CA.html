One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
