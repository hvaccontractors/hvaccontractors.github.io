<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
