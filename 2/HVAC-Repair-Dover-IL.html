<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Dover IL</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
