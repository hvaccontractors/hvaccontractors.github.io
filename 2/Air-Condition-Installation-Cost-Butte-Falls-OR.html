<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
