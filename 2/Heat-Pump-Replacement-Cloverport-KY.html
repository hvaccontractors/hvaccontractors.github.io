On those days when you simply can't seem to warm up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. Since they heat surfaces and not the air itself, in-floor heater are not prone to this concern. Furthermore, given that they do not trust fans, ducts, signs up and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can lower the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your house.<p>
