<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
