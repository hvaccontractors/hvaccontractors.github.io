<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
