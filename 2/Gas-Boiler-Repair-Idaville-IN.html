<p>As an experienced HVAC specialist, we recommend you have your systems examined and routine maintenance carried out twice per year, once in the Spring (before cooling season) and when in the Fall (before heating season).

<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Property owners might also assume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their home's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects residential or commercial property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Perhaps Realtors need to consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system might add to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That stated, homebuyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
