<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
