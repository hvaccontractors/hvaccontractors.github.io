<p>All homes need effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is important not only for employees' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, tiredness, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.
