Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
