<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
