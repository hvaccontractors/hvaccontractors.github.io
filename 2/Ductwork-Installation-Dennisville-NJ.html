<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information might determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
