<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
