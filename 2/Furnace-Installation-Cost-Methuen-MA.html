<p>Today's home radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a bathroom flooring or be installed throughout the entire sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).

Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
