<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, given that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a cruel, harsh summer season.<p>
