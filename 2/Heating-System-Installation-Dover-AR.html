<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply including refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. An experienced technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
