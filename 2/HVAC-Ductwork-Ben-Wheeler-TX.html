<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
