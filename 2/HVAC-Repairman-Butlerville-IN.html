<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals ought to be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures should not be carried out till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.)
