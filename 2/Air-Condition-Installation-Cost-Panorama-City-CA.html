<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Panorama City CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
