<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the difficulty area in looking over the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
