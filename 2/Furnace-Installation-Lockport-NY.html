<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process.
