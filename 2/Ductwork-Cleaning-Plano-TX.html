<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles. Adoption of these innovations, however, has not been extensive, as customers stay mainly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, particularly if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will get worse. Inspecting and changing the air filters is one of the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
