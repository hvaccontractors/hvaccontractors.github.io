<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience verifies that.<p>
