The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>First, know that a majority of your central air and system cost will originate from the unit itself. AC unit costs start at $2,000 and can actually go beyond $10,000 for larger homes. As you saw just recently, you require an appropriately-sized system for your house. Otherwise, the AC will break down sooner than expected or your monthly energy costs will escalate. For that reason, you don't have overall control as to your AC unit material expenses.<p>
