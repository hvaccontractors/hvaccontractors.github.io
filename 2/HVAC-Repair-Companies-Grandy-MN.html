<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
