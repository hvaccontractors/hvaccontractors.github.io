<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use contracts.  The so called credible companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits. I know because I attempted to work for them. I quit since 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without a contract and begin offering you things you do not require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to confirm the so called problems and remedies. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold like wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and ac system throughout summertime) helps in reducing moisture in indoor air and effectively controls allergens, Lang says. An air conditioning system also lowers indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -patients.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
