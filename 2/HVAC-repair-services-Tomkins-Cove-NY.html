<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.
