<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is simpler without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
