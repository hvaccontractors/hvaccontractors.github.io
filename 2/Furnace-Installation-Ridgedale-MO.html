Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
