<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
