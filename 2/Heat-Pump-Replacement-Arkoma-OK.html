<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
