<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy.
