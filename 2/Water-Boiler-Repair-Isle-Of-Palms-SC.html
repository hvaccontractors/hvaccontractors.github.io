<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
