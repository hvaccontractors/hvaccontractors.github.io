That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
