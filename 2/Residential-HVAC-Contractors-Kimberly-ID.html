<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Kimberly ID</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
