<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work.

Truthfully, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
