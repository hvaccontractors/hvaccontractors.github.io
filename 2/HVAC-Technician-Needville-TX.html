Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
