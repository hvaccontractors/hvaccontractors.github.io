<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
