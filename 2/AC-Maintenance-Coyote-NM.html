<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last job is to evaluate the system to make sure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which may be as simple as a need to replace batteries. A failure to turn on might just include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any concerns or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where suitable.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.
