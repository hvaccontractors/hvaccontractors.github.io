<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
