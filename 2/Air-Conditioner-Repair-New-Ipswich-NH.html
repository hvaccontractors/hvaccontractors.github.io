<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices. The easiest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
