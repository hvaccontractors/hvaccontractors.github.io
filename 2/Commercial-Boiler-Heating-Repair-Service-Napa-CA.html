<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
