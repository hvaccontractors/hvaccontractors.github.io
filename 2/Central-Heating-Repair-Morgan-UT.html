<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
