<p>This in flooring heating unit consists of one thin constant cable television heating element woven into a mat that you install under the tile. These heated floors are a project best done when changing the floor or upgrading covering of an existing room or when including a new space. Heated flooring can be installed as supplemental heat to take the chill out of the flooring or as space heat to warm the whole restroom. Heated flooring is also a great task for warming entranceway and cooking area floors.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered remarkable, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style gets along, efficient and appealing. He clearly and completely discussed all problems and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his capability to fix my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call right away the next morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to a problem that couldn't be dealt with on the first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
