In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
