<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your home so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are blocked, they can cause an unsafe build-up and compromise your safety. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack too. They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators.

Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
