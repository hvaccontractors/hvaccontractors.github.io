<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Cumming GA Home Owners</h3>
