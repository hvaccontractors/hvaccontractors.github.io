<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.
