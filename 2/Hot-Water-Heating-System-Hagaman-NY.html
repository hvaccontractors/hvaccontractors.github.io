<h3>Central Heating Installation in Hagaman NY</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
