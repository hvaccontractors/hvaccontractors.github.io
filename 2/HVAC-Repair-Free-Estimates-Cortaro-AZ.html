<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
