<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
