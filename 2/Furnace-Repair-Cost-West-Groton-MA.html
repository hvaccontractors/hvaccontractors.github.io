<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
