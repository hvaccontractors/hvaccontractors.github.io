Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.
