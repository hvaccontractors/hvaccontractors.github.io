<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
