The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%.

Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
