<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
