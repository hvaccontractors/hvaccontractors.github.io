According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the right temperature.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
