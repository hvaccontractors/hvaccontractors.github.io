<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and changed two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heater is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the spaces. A lot of contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
