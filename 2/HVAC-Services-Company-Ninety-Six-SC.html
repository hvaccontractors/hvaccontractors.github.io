<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced products. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it may act as a path to bring the impurities inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it must-- if debris is blocking the outside air intake, for example, or the filters are contaminated or improperly preserved.<p>
