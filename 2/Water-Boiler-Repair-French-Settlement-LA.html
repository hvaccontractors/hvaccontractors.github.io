Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heating units, scented candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may result in nose, eye, and throat irritation; fatigue; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
