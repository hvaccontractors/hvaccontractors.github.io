Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
