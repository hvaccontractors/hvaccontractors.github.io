<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
