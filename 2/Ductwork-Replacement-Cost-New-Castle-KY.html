<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in New Castle KY</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

The bonus offer: he is a really enjoyable individual to deal with, and is really excited to finish the work based on the requirements of his client. I would extremely advise him for all your HVAC requires.<p>
