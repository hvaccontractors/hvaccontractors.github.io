<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's performance. To make sure the system is working efficiently, think about having a routine coolant system flush.

Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
