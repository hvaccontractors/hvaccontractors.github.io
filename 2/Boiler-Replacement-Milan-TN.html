A qualified technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
