<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
