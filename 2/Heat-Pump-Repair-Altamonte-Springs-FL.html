<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new resident I have actually discovered how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
