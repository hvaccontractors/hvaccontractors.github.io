<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
