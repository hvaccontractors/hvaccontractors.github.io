<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
