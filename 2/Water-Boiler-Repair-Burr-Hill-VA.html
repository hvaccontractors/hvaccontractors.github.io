<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or simply a high level of competition for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
