<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.
