<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re examine and minimize the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not only lower the cost of a new system and utility expenses, however it will greatly improve the convenience of your house. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Standard improvements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend several certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact United States for referrals.<p>
