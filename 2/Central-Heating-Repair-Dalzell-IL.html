<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can exacerbate issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
