The average summer season temperature to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER rating for your location, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

The likewise quickly followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
