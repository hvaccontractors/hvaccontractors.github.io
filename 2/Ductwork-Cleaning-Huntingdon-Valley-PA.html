<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Huntingdon Valley PA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
