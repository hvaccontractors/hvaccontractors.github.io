<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
