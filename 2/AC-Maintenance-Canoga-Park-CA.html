<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
