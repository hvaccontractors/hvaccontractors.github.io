<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
