<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had found the trouble location in examining the bill. He fixed the concern in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered fair before he called back, understood what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
