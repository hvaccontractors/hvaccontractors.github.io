<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Care Tips in Higley AZ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
