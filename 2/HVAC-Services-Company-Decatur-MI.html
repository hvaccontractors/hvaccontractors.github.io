Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside pollutant, it might act as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working in addition to it should-- if particles is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are infected or badly kept.<p>
