<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this.
