<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
