<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately.

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Fort Monroe VA?</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
