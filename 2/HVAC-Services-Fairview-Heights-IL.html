<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Fairview Heights IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit.
