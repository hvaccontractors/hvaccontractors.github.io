<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
