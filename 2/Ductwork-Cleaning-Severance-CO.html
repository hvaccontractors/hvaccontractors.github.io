<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
