We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of eco-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all freshly developed homes in the U.S. in 2015.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>Similar to a lot of home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary widely based on the size of the house. The majority of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
