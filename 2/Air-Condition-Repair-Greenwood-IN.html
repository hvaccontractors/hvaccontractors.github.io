<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to order it. My spouse said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time.
