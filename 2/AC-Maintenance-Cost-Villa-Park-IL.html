If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
