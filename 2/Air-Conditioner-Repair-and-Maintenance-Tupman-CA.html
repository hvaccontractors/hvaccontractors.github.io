<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Tupman CA</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that a company must provide a healthy and safe workplace. Thus, ensuring the air is of good quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from an organisation or retailer to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided guarantee will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
