<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
