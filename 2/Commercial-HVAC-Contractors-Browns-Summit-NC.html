<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drain pipelines causes a water leak. There are many different locations an obstruction can take place. Among the primary areas where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
