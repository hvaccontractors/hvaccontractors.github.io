<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than room ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and hassle-free to operate. To save energy and cash, you must try to buy an energy-efficient air conditioner and lower your central air conditioning conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned home, a/c consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy per year, causing power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
