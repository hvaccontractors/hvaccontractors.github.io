<h3>Electric Furnace in Licking MO</h3>
<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, attempting this job is not a great idea.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem.
