<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
