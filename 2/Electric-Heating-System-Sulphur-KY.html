There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Due to the fact that it has restored my faith in excellent manufacturing, am thankful I got this though. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Provider I got given that I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
