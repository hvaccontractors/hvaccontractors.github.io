<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered terrific customer service at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better service.
