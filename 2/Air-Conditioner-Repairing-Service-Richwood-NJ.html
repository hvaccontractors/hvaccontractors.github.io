<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
