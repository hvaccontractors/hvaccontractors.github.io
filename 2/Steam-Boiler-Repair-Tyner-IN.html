<h3>HVAC Repair Cost in Tyner IN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
