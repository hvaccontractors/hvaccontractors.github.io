<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
