This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely radiant systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
