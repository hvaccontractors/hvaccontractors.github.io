Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
