<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure materials utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heater. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
