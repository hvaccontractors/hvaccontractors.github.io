<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the room, enveloping inhabitants in warmth at a lower total temperature-- in some cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
