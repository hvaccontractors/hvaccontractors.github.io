<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from.
