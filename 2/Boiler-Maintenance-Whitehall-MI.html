<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer support at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we may want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the industry.<p>
