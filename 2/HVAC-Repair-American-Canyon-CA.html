<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
