This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
