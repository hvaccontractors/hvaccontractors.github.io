<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
