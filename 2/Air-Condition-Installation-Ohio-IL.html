<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Ohio IL</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
