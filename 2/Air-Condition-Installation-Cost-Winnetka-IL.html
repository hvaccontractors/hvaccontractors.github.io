<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
