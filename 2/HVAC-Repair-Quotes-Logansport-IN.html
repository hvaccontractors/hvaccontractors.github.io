<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you select for your house. Installation aside, you will still require to call out a qualified electrician to link the system to your power supply, this may take a couple of hours and can cost anything in between $200 and $250 dependant on who you choose and where you live.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures develop up inside.<p>
<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Logansport IN</h3>
<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Purification should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can decrease the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely important to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.
