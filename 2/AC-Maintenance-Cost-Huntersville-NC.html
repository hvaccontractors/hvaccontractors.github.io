<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
