<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
