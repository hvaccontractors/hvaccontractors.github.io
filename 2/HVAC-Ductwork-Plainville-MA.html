<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
