<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Before installing any brand-new heating or cooling system in a home, it is necessary to re minimize the energy and examine load of the house. A more energy effective home will not just reduce the cost of a new system and energy bills, but it will greatly improve the convenience of your home. Before we style and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest a number of certified house Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
