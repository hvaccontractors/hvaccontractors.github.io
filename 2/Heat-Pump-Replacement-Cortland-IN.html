<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
