<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.
