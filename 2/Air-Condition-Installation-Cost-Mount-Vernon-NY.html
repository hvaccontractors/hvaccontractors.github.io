<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of illness triggered by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
