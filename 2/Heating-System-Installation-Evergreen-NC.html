<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
