<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for cooling and heating.

In addition, homeowners ought to look out to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures must not be carried out until these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>Considering that the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective.
